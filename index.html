But when you reveal its mask, you see that it is basically a lie, told to those who are vulnerable.</strong></p> <p>Narcissistic abuse, by nature, is designed to keep you trapped in shame-based vertigo.

It takes you on a deep journey and describes:</p> <p> - How we unwittingly qualify as targets of narcissists<br> - The shame/grandiosity continuum and how the narcissist uses it to crush your self-esteem<br> - The law of grandiosity and how it influences our relationships with the self-absorbed<br> - The effect that narcissism has on its target including: toxic shame, a dissociated mind and a weakened ego<br> - The obstacles which keep you trapped in a cycle of narcissistic abuse: the psychological cage, love starvation, low shame tolerance, guilt and conditioning to shamelessness<br> </p> <p>Using an inside-out approach, &#x2018;How To Kill A Narcissist&#x2019; presents the seven practices for recovery and healing:</p> <p> <strong>1.

In the hope they may become so in the English Catholic world, we are offering the public a new translation of them. Possibly no one has so insistently and perseveringly written or spoken of the Eucharist as Saint Eymard has. The Eucharist worked on the faculties of his soul like a magnet. His mind and heart, as if polarized, invariably swerved back towards their star, the Eucharist. He was never at a loss to discover some hidden link between the Eucharist and the subject under study. Like the &#34;householder who bringeth forth out of his treasure new things and old,&#34; he drew all things out of the Eucharist for every purpose. In fact he looked at the world only through the &#34;Divine prism of the mystery of the Eucharist.&#34; This Eucharistic approach to the problems of the soul is distinctive of his spirituality. Duty never came alone in its cold and austere stiffness but with something of our Eucharistic Lord in it that transformed it into a labor of love. The road that wound in and out of the shadow of the Cross was never a lonely one, for the Eucharistic Christ stood ever near with His strengthening and consoling companionship. The virtues were made lovable by being presented not in their native asperity but as actions of Jesus in the Eucharist. The result was a spirituality based on and motivated by love for Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. He made universal use of the Eucharist in his own life and advised others to do as much. In short, he laid down in theory and in practice that the Eucharist is the chief means of progress in spiritual life, the light which shows the way and supplies the needed strength to follow it. Unfortunately Saint Peter Julian never wrote nor even planned a complete treatise on the spiritual life, although his long experience with souls, his deep insight into their needs, his sure sense of the supernatural, and the stem logic of his mind eminently qualified him for such a task. However, in his sermons and letters of direction he touched practically every point of ascetical theology, so that there is in them sufficient matter for a comparatively complete study on the spiritual life. The present volume, The Real Presence, is a collection of sermons that deal almost exclusively with the wonders operated by our Lord&#39;s love in the Eucharist. From every page, Saint Peter Julian, the &#34;Priest of the Eucharist,&#34; sends a ringing plea to all men to love our Eucharistic Lord as He deserves and to take Him as both the model and the means of their holiness. Pondering over these chapters cannot but make us know better and love more the Eucharistic Christ. And with a more practical understanding of this supereminent means of grace, the problem of salvation should be easier to solve. May His Eucharistic Kingdom come! That was Saint Peter Julian&#39;s most ardent wish.</p><p>1811-1868, Founder. Born in LaMure, France, he worked at his father&#39;s trade as cutler until eighteen when he went to the seminary at Grenoble and was ordained in 1834. He served as a parish priest for several years then joined the Marists and in 1845 became their provincial at Lyons. He established the Servants of the Blessed Sacrament whose nuns devoted themselves to perpetual adoration.</p><h2>The Robert Collier Letter Book: Fifth Edition</h2><p><p>2018 Reprint of 1941 Fifth Edition.

Now, in <i>This Time Together</i>, Carol really lets her hair down and tells one funny or touching or memorable story after another. <br>&nbsp;<br>In engaging anecdotes, Carol discusses her remarkable friendships with stars such as Jimmy Stewart, Lucille Ball, Cary Grant, and Julie Andrews; the background behind famous scenes, like the moment she swept down the stairs in her curtain-rod dress in the legendary &#x201c;Went with the Wind&#x201d; skit; and things that would happen only to Carol&#x2014;the prank with Julie Andrews that went wrong in front of the First Lady; the famous Tarzan Yell that saved her during a mugging; and the time she faked a wooden leg to get served in a famous ice cream emporium. <br><br>This poignant look back allows us to cry with the actress during her sorrows, rejoice in her successes, and finally, always, to laugh.</p><p><b>Carol Burnett&nbsp;</b>has been an actor on Broadway, on television, and in the movies. She has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, The Mark Twain Prize for Humor and the Kennedy Center Honors, among other singular achievements of a woman comedian who was nothing less than a pioneer and a role model for stars like Tina Fey, Amy Pohler and Amy Schumer.During the past few years, I&#x2019;ve zigzagged across the country appearing in various theaters performing Laughter and Reflection: A Conversation with Carol, Where the Audience Asks the Questions. It&#x2019;s just the audience and me. The evening lasts ninety minutes, beginning with seven minutes of old Q &amp; A clips from our TV variety show to give the audience an idea of what the evening is going to be like. Then I come out onstage and ask for the lights to be bumped up, so I can see everyone.<br><br>Lights up.<br><br>Me: Tonight is all about any questions you might have for me . . . about our show, the people I&#x2019;ve worked with, moments that stand out in your memory that you&#x2019;re curious about&#x2014;anything at all. So just raise your hands, and here we go!<br><br>It&#x2019;s always a little scary, because I&#x2019;m working without a safety net. There are no &#x201c;plants&#x201d; in the audience, because if the event feels pre-planned, it takes the fun out of it. The audience can tell it&#x2019;s off the cuff, and through the years people have been pretty enthusiastic&#x2014;and aren&#x2019;t at all shy about raising their hands. When I call on someone I never know what the question will be. I have to say, it keeps the ol&#x2019; gray matter ticking and the blood pumping.<br><br>However, through the years there have been questions that were asked over and over, which gives me a breather by allowing me to count on being able to tell some set stories. If these questions weren&#x2019;t asked (for instance, if the audience was sitting on its hands), often I could bring up the subject myself and tell the story anyway. (Whew!)<br><br>What follows are some of these stories that I&#x2019;ve shared over the years in response to various questions. Some have to do with our gang on the variety show, embarrassing moments, famous people, not-so-famous people, family, and so on. Since I&#x2019;m not planning on doing too many more of these story evenings in the future, I figured I&#x2019;d write up my favorite stories for my grandkids and anybody else who might enjoy them&#x2014;who might have some fun and laughs and maybe some nostalgic moments as well.<br><br>Many years ago, in 1986, I wrote a memoir called <i>One More Time</i>, which was couched as a letter to my three daughters, telling them all about my growing up in a dysfunctional yet loving family. That book didn&#x2019;t take my life beyond age twenty-six. This time I&#x2019;m emphasizing episodes and anecdotes that have brought me to the present time, although I&#x2019;ve also included a few stories from childhood that bear repeating. Originally I began writing this book as a simple series of anecdotes, but as I got into it I found that I went into more detail than I usually do onstage. I also found myself writing about things that I haven&#x2019;t talked about onstage but which resonate with me. Some of them are even serious. These thoughts and feelings just kind of poured out onto the page. They might not be as amusing as some of my other remembrances, but they&#x2019;re memories I&#x2019;d like to share. So what follows is a kind of memoir peppered with anecdotes here and there. I hope you enjoy it.<br><br>***<br><br><i>Rumplemayer&#x2019;s and the Mean Hostess</i><br><br>During the summer of 1959 Once upon a Mattress was enjoying a healthy run, and a few of us in the cast decided to splurge one Saturday night after the show and treat ourselves to a sundae at the most expensive ice cream parlor in New York City: Rumplemayer&#x2019;s, in the St. Moritz Hotel on Central Park South. Even though Mattress had been running for a few months and I had done some television, I was far from being recognizable in public. Nonetheless, I was flush with the excitement of being in a hit stage show and raking in $80 a week to boot. I could afford a Rumplemayer&#x2019;s treat.<br><br>Rumplemayer&#x2019;s was a pretty posh ice cream parlor. You could spot familiar faces there anytime after the bows had been taken and the lights had dimmed on Broadway for the night. Some folks went to nightclubs or bars, but those who had a sweet tooth and who also wanted to be seen went to Rumplemayer&#x2019;s. I remember having peeked in a few months earlier and spotting Marlene Dietrich in a gorgeous gray pantsuit at the counter, elegantly digging a long-handled spoon into a whipped cream goodie.<br><br>On this night four of us pushed our way through the re olving door and stood casing the scene as we waited for the hostess. It was crowded, but there were a couple of empty tables in the back. The hostess, in a blue dress with a white collar and cuffs and sporting a very tight bun in her hair, approached us with menus. She took a closer look, and smoke began to come out of her ears.<br><br>&#x201c;EXCUSE ME! But just what do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br><br>She was looking straight at me.<br><br>&#x201c;Pardon me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I SAID, what do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br><br>Before I could speak, she went off on a major tear. &#x201c;Young woman, don&#x2019;t you realize that we don&#x2019;t allow ladies in RUMPLEMAYER&#x2019;S wearing SLACKS? SL-ACKS&#x201d;&#x2014;she made it two syllables and pronounced them like a dirty word&#x2014;&#x201c;are FOR-BID-DEN!&#x201d;<br><br>She was actually screaming at me. Her pipes could&#x2019;ve given Ethel Merman a run for her money. I wondered if maybe her bun was too tight. Suddenly I noticed that the place had become strangely quiet: fewer clinking spoons, less slurping through straws. More than a few customers were watching us, evidently waiting to see if the hostess was going to shoot me. I was feeling like an axe murderer and at the same time awfully humiliated. I was dressed in a nice pair of black slacks, not jeans, but apparently that was still enough of a social gaffe for her to send me up the river and put me in solitary.<br><br>My friends and I were frozen in place, but this lady wouldn&#x2019;t quit. I looked for the swastika on her sleeve as she continued her harangue.<br><br>&#x201c;DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? FOR-BID-DEN!&#x201d;<br><br>I was about to slink out backward when the image of Marlene Dietrich came to me out of nowhere. She had been in SL-ACKS and nobody had yelled at her. And all this hostess needed to do with us was to nicely explain the rules. It could have gone thusly:<br><br>Hostess: (quietly) I&#x2019;m awfully sorry, miss, but Rumplemayer&#x2019;s has a dress code, and ladies are not seated if they&#x2019;re wearing slacks. I do hope you and your friends will come back and see us soon. Here&#x2019;s a mint.<br><br>Me: (quietly) Oh, of course. I&#x2019;m sorry, I didn&#x2019;t know. We&#x2019;ll definitely come back another time, and thank you so much for the mint. (We exit with dignity.)<br><br>End of Scene.<br><br>Simple. No problem. But noooo.<br><br>Astonishingly, she was still at it, not only for our benefit now, but clearly for that of the entire restaurant: &#x201c;I DON&#x2019;T KNOW WHERE YOU KIDS GET OFF THINKING YOU CAN BREAK THE RULES WHENEVER YOU WANT!&#x201d;<br><br>You could&#x2019;ve heard a pin drop. At this point, the image of Dietrich in pants was looming full screen in my mind&#x2019;s eye. I opened my mouth to speak.<br><br>&#x201c;Please forgive me,&#x201d; I said sweetly (but projecting so that every customer could hear), &#x201c;but I have a wooden leg, and I&#x2019;m too embarrassed to wear a skirt.&#x201d;<br><br>Dead silence. I felt the entire restaurant getting ready to line the hostess up in front of a firing squad. She felt it, too. She led us to a back table. I dragged my wooden leg all the way across the room without bending my knee and ate my hot fudge sundae while sitting stiff-legged the whole time.<br><br>The revenge tasted sweeter than the sundae.</p><h2>Aromas of Aleppo: The Legendary Cuisine of Syrian Jews</h2><p><p><em> When the Aleppian Jewish community migrated from the ancient city of Aleppo in historic Syria and settled in New York and Latin American cities in the early 20th century, it brought its rich cuisine and vibrant culture.

That enemy is&nbsp;<i>China,&nbsp;</i>a country<br> <ul> <li>that invented totalitarianism thousands of years ago</li> <li>whose economic power rivals our own</li> <li>that believes its superior race and culture give it the right to universal deference</li> <li>that teaches its people to hate America for standing in the way of achieving its narcissistic "dream" of world domination</li> <li>that believes in its manifest destiny to usher in the World of Great Harmony</li> <li>which publishes maps showing the exact extent of the nuclear destruction it could rain down on the United States&nbsp;</li> </ul> <br>Steven Mosher exposes the resurgent aspirations of the would-be hegemon&#x2013;and the roots of China's will to domination in its five-thousand-year history of ruthless conquest and assimilation of other nations, brutal repression of its own people, and belligerence toward any civilization that challenges its claim to superiority.<br> <br>The&nbsp;na�ve idealism of our "China hands" has lulled America into a fool's dream of "engagement" with the People's Republic of China and its "peaceful evolution" toward democracy and freedom. Wishful thinking, says Mosher, has blinded us to the danger we face and left the owlrd vulnerable to China's overweening ambitions.<br> <br>Mosher knows China as few Westerners do. Having exposed as a visiting graduate student the monstrous practice of forced abortions, he became the target of the regime's crushing retaliation. His encyclopedic grasp of China's history and its present-day politics, his astute insights, and his bracing realism are the perfect antidote for our dangerous confusion about the Bully of Asia.</p><p>Steven W. Mosher is president of the Population Research Institute and an internationally recognized authority on China. He is also the author of numerous books on China, among them <em>Broken Earth: The Rural Chinese</em>, <em>A Mother's Ordeal: One Woman's Fight Against China's One-Child Policy</em>, and <em>Hegemon: China's Plan to Dominate Asia and the World</em>, as well as several edited volumes and hundreds of scholarly articles, editorials, and opinion pieces.With mounting admiration I have read Bully of Asia. Mosher's new book is the most sophisticated, up to date, richly-based argument in existence for dangers in the Rise of China - dangers to the giant's neighbors and to America. The author has long experience of China, writes beautifully, knows ancient history, and cares about the values of the democratic West and its friends. Bully of Asia burst's the bubble of Beltway liberals' trembling over risks in "upsetting China." Beijing is realistic; Mosher, digging beneath the surface of current issues, urges the US to be realistic too.<br><br>Dr. Ross Terrill, Fairbank Center, Harvard University</p><h2>Clockwork Boys (1) (Clocktaur War)</h2><p><p>A paladin, an assassin, a forger, and a scholar ride out of town.

Kennedy, C. S. Lewis Aldous Huxley</h2><p>On November 22, 1963, three great men died within a few hours of each other: C. S. Lewis, John F. Kennedy and Aldous Huxley. All three believed, in different ways, that death is not the end of human life. Suppose they were right, and suppose they met after death. How might the conversation go? Peter Kreeft imagines their discussion as a part of The Great Conversation that has been going on for centuries. Does human life have meaning? Is it possible to know about life after death? What if one could prove that Jesus was God? With Kennedy taking the role of a modern humanist, Lewis representing Christian theism and Huxley advocating Eastern pantheism, the dialogue is lively and informative. This new edition of this classic work includes a postscript in which Kreeft describes why and how he wrote what has remained a standard of apologetic literature for a generation. He also adds an outline and index to the book as well as a never-before-published dialog in which he imagines &#34;A World Without an Easter.&#34; Now more than ever this book offers an animated interaction that involves not only good thinking but good drama.</p><p>* Provides a dramatic exploration of life after death <br>* Highlights common perspectives represented by C.

Now we live in a day when convenience and practicality have largely displaced beauty as a value. The church is no exception. Even salvation is commonly viewed in a scientific and mechanistic manner and presented as a plan, system, or formula.<br> <br> In <i>Beauty Will Save the World</i>, Brian Zahnd presents the argument that this loss of beauty as a principal value has been disastrous for Western culture, and especially for the church. The full message of the beauty of the gospel has been replaced by our desires to satisfy our material needs, to empirically prove our faith, and to establish political power in our world--the exact same things that Christ was tempted with and rejected in the wilderness.</p> <p> Zahnd shows that by following the teachings of the Beatitudes, the church can become a viable alternative to current-day political, commercial, and religious power and can actually achieve what these powers promise to provide but fail to deliver. Using stories from the lives of St. Francis of Assisi and from his own life, he teaches us to stay on the journey to discover the kingdom of God in a fuller, richer, more beautiful, way.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Brian Zahnd</b> is the founding pastor of Word of Life Church in St. Joseph, Missouri.<p>"Brian Zahnd is blunt, bold, and biblical&#x2014;an authentic prophetic voice in the lineage of Elijah and Amos." &#x2014;Eugene H.

Or do we? This uniquely American holiday has a rich and little known history beyond the famous feast of 1621.<br> <br>In <i>Thanksgiving</i>, award-winning author Melanie Kirkpatrick journeys through four centuries of history, giving us a vivid portrait of our nation's best-loved holiday. Drawing on newspaper accounts, private correspondence, historical documents, and cookbooks, <i>Thanksgiving</i> brings to life the full history of the holiday and what it has meant to generations of Americans.<br> <br>Many famous figures walk these pages&#x2014;Washington, who proclaimed our first Thanksgiving as a nation amid controversy about his Constitutional power to do so; Lincoln, who wanted to heal a divided nation sick of war when he called for all Americans&#x2014;North and South&#x2014;to mark a Thanksgiving Day; FDR, who set off a debate on state's rights when he changed the traditional date of Thanksgiving.<br> <br>Ordinary Americans also play key roles in the Thanksgiving story&#x2014;the New England Indians who boycott Thanksgiving as a Day of Mourning; Sarah Josepha Hale, the nineteenth-century editor and feminist who successfully campaigned for Thanksgiving to be a national holiday; the 92nd Street Y in New York City, which founded Giving Tuesday, an online charity established in the long tradition of Thanksgiving generosity. Kirkpatrick also examines the history of Thanksgiving football and, of course, Thanksgiving dinner.<br> <br>While the rites and rituals of the holiday have evolved over the centuries, its essence remains the same: family and friends feasting together in a spirit of gratitude to God, neighborliness, and hospitality. Thanksgiving is Americans' oldest tradition. Kirkpatrick's enlightening exploration offers a fascinating look at the meaning of the holiday that we gather together to celebrate on the fourth Thursday of November.<br> <br>With <i>Readings for Thanksgiving Day</i> designed to be read aloud around the table.<br></p><p>Melanie Kirkpatrick is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a former deputy editor of The Wall Street Journal's editorial page.

It is the time to carry on customs whose origins have been lost in the past.<br><br>Kathleen Stokker's Keeping Christmas: Yuletide Traditions in Norway and the New Land brings home the stories of Christmas customs in both countries. Norwegian immigrants carried with them the folk traditions, developed over centuries, that shaped their identities, and they held those practices especially dear at Christmas time, remembering family members left behind. But in the U.S., they and their descendents met the newly evolving traditions of the highly commercial American Christmas, a powerful homogenizing force in a nation of immigrants. And the celebration of Christmas in Norway continued to evolve as well, as the holiday&#x2014;influenced in the twentieth century by U.S. practices&#x2014;became more child-centered and more commercial. Stokker describes and traces the development of folkways on both sides of the ocean, from their origins to their practice today.<br><br>With fascinating details, with scores of accounts of ancient and modern Christmases, with recipes and photographs, this book reminds Norwegians and Norwegian Americans of their connections to each other and explains how their celebrations differ on this most joyous of holidays.</p><p>Kathleen Stokker is a professor of Norwegian at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa.

He was born in what is now known as Zimbabwe and lives in Scotland, where in his spare time he is a bassoonist in the RTO (Really Terrible Orchestra).Chapter One<br><br>The girl in this picture is called Precious. That was her first name, and her second name was Ramotswe, and when all this happened she was nine. Nine is a good age to be. Some people like being nine so much that they really want to stay that age forever. They usually turn ten, however, and then they find out that being ten is not all that bad either. Precious, of course, was very happy being nine.<br><br>Like many of us, Precious had a number of aunts&#x2014;three in fact. One of these aunts lived in the village in Botswana where Precious was born, while another lived on an ostrich farm almost one hundred miles away. And a third, who was probably her favorite aunt of all, lived right up at the top of the country, in a place called the Okavango Delta. That&#x2019;s a lovely name, isn&#x2019;t it? Try saying it. OKA-VANGO. <br><br>A delta, of course, is made up of small rivers spreading out from a bigger river, a little bit like a human hand and its fingers. <br><br>Usually deltas are on the edge of the sea&#x2014;this one was not. The great Okavango River flowed backward&#x2014;away from the sea, to spread out into smaller streams that simply sank into the sands of a desert. And where this happened, there were wide plains of golden grass dotted with trees. On the bank of the river itself, the trees towered high. That was a bit like a proper jungle, and you had to be very careful when making your way through it. It was all very wild, and was home to just about every sort of wild animal to be found in Africa.<br><br>The aunt who lived up there was called Aunty Bee. Precious had been told her real name, but had forgotten it. Nobody ever called Aunty Bee anything but Bee. It was just the way it was.<br><br>Aunty Bee was not one of those aunts who scold you or tell you what to do. She was fun. She was also very generous and never forgot to send Precious a present on her birthday. And what presents these were! They were all made by Aunty Bee herself, from things that she could pick up in the bush around her. <br><br>One year there was a hat made entirely out of porcupine quills. As you know, porcupines are very prickly animals that have coats made of extraordinary black-and-white quills. These are sharp, and if anything tries to attack the porcupine all that he has to do is shoot out these quills. The animal attacking him then learns a very painful lesson: do not try to eat a porcupine! Indeed, some say that this is the very first lesson that a mother lion or leopard teaches her children: do not try to eat a porcupine! Unfortunately, some of them do not listen: <br><br>The porcupine hat was made of quills that Aunty Bee had found lying around on a path. She picked these up and took them to make into a hat. <br><br>Precious was very proud of it. <br><br>&#x201c;What a beautiful hat,&#x201d; people remarked. &#x201c;May we touch it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Precious. &#x201c;But I wouldn&#x2019;t, if I were you!&#x201d;<br><br>Another present Aunty Bee sent one year was a bracelet made of twisted elephant hair. This was very special, as people said that elephant hair was lucky. Such bracelets were also very rare, as the elephant hair had to be plucked from the end of the elephant&#x2019;s tail, and it was very dangerous to do that. Elephants do not like you to pull their tails, even if all you want is to borrow a few hairs for a bracelet.<br><br>Aunty Bee bought that elephant hair from a man who was very thin. People said that an elephant had sat on him and squashed him a bit, but nobody knew whether or not that was true. But it certainly made an interesting story to tell to people who admired the bracelet.<br><br>And there were other presents, too. There was a cup made out of the seedpod of a great baobab tree. These trees are very wide and fat: so wide that it can take twenty people holding hands to go all the way round them. Think of that! Twenty people!<br><br>It was not just on her birthday that Precious heard from her Aunty Bee. Often a letter would arrive with news of what was happening up at the safari camp where she worked. A safari camp is a place where people go to make trips into the wilderness. They go out for days on end to see wild animals and take photographs of them. They live in tents and eat out in the open and usually enjoy themselves very much indeed.<br><br>The camp that Aunty Bee worked in was called Eagle Island Camp. She was one of the cooks there, but she also earned a bit of money telling stories to the visitors. She knew all the old Botswana stories and would recite these beside the fireside at night. People loved to hear these and would clap and clap after she finished.<br><br>Aunty Bee was very busy but she always seemed to find the time to write to Precious, even if the letters were not very long&#x2014;one or two lines perhaps. And it was in one of these short letters that she asked Precious whether she would like to come up to visit her.<br><br>&#x201c;Dear Precious,&#x201d; she wrote, &#x201c;I know that the school holidays are coming up soon. Would you like to come and stay with me up at the safari camp for a few days? Something very exciting is about to happen. I do hope you can come. With love, Aunty Bee.&#x201d;<br><br>How would you answer a letter like that? Exactly&#x2014;so would I!<br><br>Chapter Two<br><br>When Precious showed this letter to her father, Obed Ramotswe, he looked doubtful. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long way away,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It takes a whole day to get there&#x2014;sometimes more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind,&#x201d; said Precious. &#x201c;There are buses that go that way, aren&#x2019;t there?&#x201d;<br><br>Obed scratched his head. &#x201c;That costs money,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ve had a lot of bills to pay this month.&#x201d;<br><br>Precious tried not to show her disappointment. Her father was kind to her, and she knew that he would do anything to make her happy. If he said that there was no money for the bus fare, then she knew that this would be true.<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps I can go some other time,&#x201d; she said quietly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll write to Aunty Bee and tell her.&#x201d;<br><br>Obed held up a hand. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that. I think I may know somebody who&#x2019;s going up there for four or five days. He&#x2019;s a cattle buyer and he has some business to do in those parts. He might be able to give you a ride up in his truck.&#x201d;<br><br>Precious hardly dared hope. &#x201c;Do you think so?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t take up much room.&#x201d;<br><br>Her father smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ask him,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He owes me a favor, anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>That evening, Precious wrote a reply to her aunt telling her that there was a chance&#x2014;just a chance&#x2014;she would be able to come to stay with her. The next day, though, even before she had time to post this letter, her father went to have a word with his friend. When he returned to the house, he was full of smiles.<br><br>&#x201c;You can do your packing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be leaving tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>Precious was too excited to go to sleep easily that night. Eventually she dropped off, and dreamed that she was already up in the Delta. There were tall trees, and these trees were full of monkeys, swinging adventurously from every branch. There was a wide river, filled with clear, swift-flowing water, and in this water there were the long dark shapes of crocodiles and fat, floating hippos. There were wide plains of high grass, and in this grass, half-hidden and staring out with large yellow eyes, there were lions.<br><br>She awoke to her father&#x2019;s voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Time to get up, my darling,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The truck will be here any moment now.&#x201d;<br><br>She leapt out of bed and dressed quickly. Her father had made her a breakfast of thick porridge and goat&#x2019;s milk, and she ate this while he checked that she had everything she needed. There was a little bit of money&#x2014;not much&#x2014;tied up in an old handkerchief. &#x201c;You can use that to buy yourself a treat,&#x201d; he said. <br><br>She wiped the traces of milk from her lips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll buy you a present,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to do that,&#x201d; he said, smiling. &#x201c;You may need some food on the way. Use it for something like that.&#x201d;<br><br>There came the sound of a horn from the road outside.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be the truck,&#x201d; said her father. &#x201c;Off you go, now.&#x201d;<br><br>Obed&#x2019;s friend was called Mr. Poletsi. He was traveling with his wife, who was called Mma Poletsi, and there were ten passengers&#x2014;friends and friends of friends&#x2014;who had crowded into the back of the truck. The Poletsis sat in the front, in the cab, while everybody else made themselves as comfortable as they could in the back. There were also several chickens in a small coop, a dog tied to somebody&#x2019;s toe with a piece of string, and a baby goat. Precious thought it a very strange mixture, but the important thing for her was that she was on her way to see her aunt. That was all that mattered, she thought.<br><br>In spite of the fact that the truck was crowded, everybody seemed to be in a good mood and very happy to be traveling together. Some of the others had brought food with them, and this they shared with their fellow passengers. Precious knew that this was very important. She had been taught to share, as people are taught in Africa, and if she had had any food with her she would have shared it too.<br><br>At the beginning of the journey, it was cool enough sitting in the back of the truck, but as the day wore on it became hotter and hotter. Now, with the midday sun directly above them in the sky, it became very uncomfortable for the passengers and Precious would have given anything to be sitting in the comfort of the cab with the Poletsis, but she knew that this was impossible. <br><br>They stopped at a small store along the side of the road and they were able to have a long drink of water before continuing. This helped, but after half an hour or so she began to feel thirsty again.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope we arrive soon,&#x201d; she said to the woman sitting beside her.<br><br>The woman laughed. &#x201c;Oh, we won&#x2019;t arrive soon,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve still got hundreds of miles to go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When will we arrive?&#x201d; asked Precious.<br><br>&#x201c;Midnight, I think,&#x201d; said the woman. &#x201c;Not before.&#x201d;<br><br>The road was straight and narrow, with very little traffic on it. For mile after mile it ran across great empty plains that stretched out on either side as far as the eye could see. And it was while they were crossing one of these plains that the truck&#x2019;s engine suddenly coughed and died. One moment it was working and the next moment there was silence as the truck drew slowly to a halt.<br><br>They all got out. Mr. Poletsi opened the front of the truck and looked at the engine. He soon enough found the problem&#x2014;a broken fanbelt. &#x201c;This is very bad,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to wait until somebody comes past. Then I can ask them to take me to the nearest town. I&#x2019;ll find a new fanbelt and come back with it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that could take hours,&#x201d; said one of the passengers. &#x201c;We may be here the whole night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see no other way,&#x201d; said Mr. Poletsi. And then he added: &#x201c;Unless anybody else has got any bright ideas?&#x201d;<br><br>Precious looked at the fanbelt. It had been a complete circle, a bit like a massive elastic band&#x2014;now it was just a single strip of rather sad-looking rubber.<br><br>She looked down. She was wearing the belt that her father had bought her a few weeks before. She was very proud of it, but this was clearly an emergency.<br><br>&#x201c;Has anybody got some string?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>The woman who had been sitting beside her replied that she had some and passed it to her.<br><br>Precious took off her belt. Carefully threading the string through one of the holes in the belt, she made it into a strong circle, exactly the size of the broken fanbelt.<br><br>Mr. Poletsi was watching her. &#x201c;You clever girl,&#x201d; he exclaimed. &#x201c;I can see what you&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;<br><br>The makeshift fanbelt fit perfectly. Mr. Poletsi then closed the engine compartment and went back to his place in the cab. There was an anxious moment as everybody waited to see whether the truck would start. But it did, and it ran perfectly sweetly with the repair that Precious had made.<br><br>&#x201c;I think you should come and sit with us in the front,&#x201d; said Mma Poletsi. &#x201c;As a reward for what you&#x2019;ve done.&#x201d;<br><br>Everybody agreed that this was well-deserved, and so Precious made the rest of the journey in comfort, snuggling up against Mma Poletsi in the cab while the sun dropped down below the horizon. She felt proud and happy, and of course excited. Very soon she would be seeing Aunty Bee and finding out what the exciting thing was that her aunt had talked about.<br><br>Chapter Three<br><br>They arrived at Eagle Island Camp by night. It was very different from home, where the lights of houses and of cars meant that it was never really dark; here in the bush there was complete darkness, with only one or two tiny pinpricks of light showing from a campfire or a hut. Precious was sleepy, and Aunty Bee said that she should go straight to bed.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see where you are when you wake up in the morning,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be plenty of time to explore then.&#x201d;<br><br>Her aunt had laid out a mattress on the floor in her own room, and Precious found this very comfortable. She closed her eyes and in less than a minute she was fast asleep, not waking up until the first rays of the sun came through the window the next day.<br><br>She looked about her, half-forgetting where she was. But then she remembered, and got up to dress herself as quickly as she could. There were sounds coming from the kitchen next door, which meant that Aunty Bee was already preparing breakfast.<br><br>She greeted her aunt and sat down at the table. Through the open door of the kitchen she could see that Aunty Bee&#x2019;s house was in the middle of a circle of small buildings that housed the people who worked in the safari camp. Not far away, at the end of a path that ran through a clump of very high trees, was the camp itself. This was made up of thatched huts on the edge of a river, all joined to one another by a raised wooden walkway. It looked like a very exciting place to stay.</p><h2>Honest Pretzels: And 64 Other Amazing Recipes for Cooks Ages 8 &amp; Up</h2><p><b><b>Are you a kid?</b>&nbsp;Then this cookbook was written especially for you.&nbsp;<br><br>Get ready to help with dinner for real!&nbsp;</b>You can become a fantastic cook and amaze your friends with PITA SPIRALS and CREAMY CORN SOUP or CINNAMON SWIRL STICKY BUNS and BEST HOT CHOCOLATE.

Essentially a dialogue between the radical theologian and Episcopalian priest Fox and maverick biologist Sheldrake, this book is a bizarre amalgam of New Age speculation and exploration of the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite, Thomas Aquinas and Hildegard of Bingen for news of angels. Of angel lore there is much of merit in this book, but the book is irritating when it pretends to be science rather than spirituality. The authors' work would have benefited from a heavier editorial hand, for the book often reads like an e-mail exchange in which the effort at dialogue too easily descends into monologue. Fox and Sheldrake have written a book that is charming without being dangerous. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The A to Z of Foreign Musical Terms: From Adagio to Zierlich a Dictionary for Performers and Students</h2><p>The A to Z of Foreign Musical Terms</p><p></p><h2>The World According to Humphrey</h2><p>The first in the series about everyone's favorite classroom pet!<br><br> You can learn a lot about life by observing another species.

It's hard to make sense when your heart is broken.)<br>On the other hand, until Ms. Mac arrived, I was going nowhere down at Pet-O-Rama. My days were spent sitting around, looking at a bunch of furry things in cages just like mine. We were treated all right: regular meals, clean cages, music piped in all day.<br>Over the music, Carl, the store clerk, would answer the phone: &#x201c;Open nine to nine, seven days a week.

Sometimes I'd see human eyes and noses (not always as clean as they should be) poking up against the glass. Nothing ever came of it. The children were excited to see me, but the parents usually had other ideas.<br>&#x201c;Oh, come see the fishes, Cornelia. So colorful and so much easier to take care of than a hamster," Mama might say.<br>Or "No, no, Norbert. They have the cutest little pup� pies over here. After all, a dog is a boy's best friend."<br>So there we were: hamsters, gerbils, mice and guinea pigs-not nearly as popular as the fish, cats or dogs. I suspected that I'd be spinning my wheel at Pet-O-Rama forever.<br>But once Ms. Mac carried me out the door a short six weeks ago, my life changed FAST-FAST-FAST. I saw Fifth! I saw Alder! I saw the Dairy Maid with the statue of a cow in an apron outside!<br>I was dozing when she first came to Pet-0-Rama, as I do during the day because hamsters are more active at night.<br>&#x201c;Hello." A warm voice awakened me. When I opened my eyes, I saw a mass of bouncy black curls. A big, happy smile. Huge dark eyes. She smelled of apples. It was love at first sight.<br>&#x201c;Aren't you the bright-eyed one?" she asked.<br>&#x201c;And might I return the compliment?" I replied. Of course, it came out &#x201c;Squeak-squeak-squeak," as usual.<br>Ms. Mac opened up her purse with the big pink and blue flowers on it.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take him," she told Carl. &#x201c;He's obviously the most intelligent and handsome hamster you have."<br>Carl grunted. Then Ms. Mac picked out a respectable cage-okay, not the three-story pagoda I'd had my eye on-but a nice cage.<br>And soon, amid squeals of encouragement from my friends in the Small Pet Department, from the teeniest white mouse to the lumbering chinchilla, I left Pet-0-Rama with high hopes.<br>We sped down the street in Ms. Mac's bright yellow car! (She called it a Bug, but I could see it was really a car.) She carried my cage up the stairs to her apartment! We ate apples! We watched TV! She let me run around outside my cage! She gave me my very own name: Humphrey. And she told me all about Room 26, where we'd be going the next morning.<br>&#x201c;And since you are an intelligent hamster who is going to school, I have a present for you, Humphrey," she said.<br>Then she gave me a tiny little notebook and a tiny little pencil. iii got these for you at the doll shop," she explained. She tucked them behind my mirror where no one could see them except me.<br>&#x201c;Of course, it might be a while before you learn to read and write," she continued. &#x201c;But you're smart and I know you'll catch on fast."<br>Little did she know I could already make out some words from my long, boring days at Pet-O-Rama.<br>Words like&nbsp;<i>Chew Toys. Kibble. Pooper-Scoopers.</i><br>Remember, a hamster is grown up at about five weeks old. So if I could learn all the skills I need for life in five weeks, how long could it possibly take to learn to read?<br>I&#x2019;ll tell you: a week. Yep, in a week I could read and even write a little with the tiny pencil.<br>In addition to schoolwork, I learned quite a bit about the other students in Room 26. Like Lower-Your-Voice�A.J. and Speak-Up-Sayeh and Wait-for-the-Bell-Garth and Golden-Miranda. (Even after I found out her name is really Miranda Golden, I thought of her as Golden�Miranda because of her long blonde hair. After all, I am a Golden Hamster.)<br>Yes, life in Room 26 suited me well during the day. My cage had all the comforts a hamster could ask for. I had bars on the window to protect me from my enemies. I had a little sleeping house in one corner where no one could see me or bother me. There was my wheel to spin on, of course, and a lovely pile of nesting material. My mirror came in handy to check my grooming (and to hide my notebook). In one corner, I kept my food. The opposite corner was my bathroom area because hamsters like to keep their poo away from their food. (Who doesn't?) All my needs were taken care of in one convenient cage.<br>At night, I went home from school with Ms. Mac and we watched TV or listened to music. Sometimes Ms. Mac played her bongo drums. She made a tunnel on the floor so I could race and wiggle to my hamster heart's content.<br>Oh, the memories of those six weeks with Morgan McNamara. That's her real name, but she told her students to call her Ms. Mac. That's how nice she is. Or was. On the weekends, Ms. Mac and I had all kinds of ad� ventures. She put me in her shirt pocket (right over her heart!) and took me with her to the laundry room. She had friends over and they laughed and made a fuss over me. She even took me for a bike ride once. I can still feel the wind in my fur!<br>I didn&#x2019;t have an inkling&#x2014;until this morning&#x2014;of the unsqueakable thing she was about to do to me. On the way to work she said, "Humphrey, I hate to tell you, but this is my last day in Room 26 and I'm going to miss you more than you&#x2019;ll ever know.&#x201d;<br>What was she saying? I hung on to my wheel for dear life! &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You see it&#x2019;s really Mrs. Brisbane&#x2019;s class. But just before school started, her husband was in an accident, so I took over the class. Today, she&#x2019;s coming back for good.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>Good? I could see nothing good in what Ms. Mac was saying.<br>&#x201c;Besides, I want to see the world, Humphrey,&#x201d; she told me.<br>Fine with me. I&#x2019;ve thoroughly enjoyed all the world I&#x2019;ve seen so far and would go to the ends of the earth with Ms. Mac. But she wasn&#x2019;t finished yet.<br>&#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t take you with me.&#x201d;<br>All hopes dashed. Completely.<br>&#x201c;Besides the kids need you to teach them responsibility. Mrs. Brisbane needs you too.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Unfortunately, she didn&#x2019;t tell Mrs. Brisbane that.<br>Mrs. Brisbane was already in Room 26 when we arrived. She smiled at Ms. Mac and shook her hand.<br>Then she frowned at me and said, &#x201c;Is that some kind of...<i>rodent</i>?&#x201d;<br>Ms. Mac gave her the speech about how much kids can learn from taking care of another species.<br>Mrs. Brisbane looked horrified and said, &#x201c;<i>I can&#x2019;t stand rodents!</i>&nbsp;Take<i>&nbsp;it</i>&nbsp;back!&#x201d;<br>The<i>&nbsp;it</i>&nbsp;she was talking about was me.<br>Ms. Mac didn&#x2019;t bat an eyelash. She put my cage in its usual place next to the window and said the kids were already very attached to me. She attached Dr. Harvey H. Hammer&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Guide to the Care and Feeding of Hamsters</i>&nbsp;to the cage, along with a chart to make sure I was fed and my cage was cleaned on time.<br>"The children know what to do. You won&#x2019;t have to do a thing,&#x201d; Ms. Mac said as Mrs. Brisbane glared at me.&nbsp;<br>Just then, my fellow students came streaming into the room and within half an hour Ms. Mac had said good-bye to everyone, including me.<br>"I&#x2019;ll never forget you, Humphrey,&#x201d; she whispered. "Don't you forget me, either."<br>"Not likely. But I don't know if I can ever forgive you,&#x201d; I squeaked.<br>And then she was gone. Without me.<br>Mrs. Brisbane didn't even come close to my cage until recess. Then she walked over and said, "Mister, you've got to go."<br>But she doesn't know my secret: The latch on my cage door doesn&#x2019;t work. It never has. It's the lock-that�doesn&#x2019;t-lock.<br>So I&#x2019;ve got news for Mrs. Brisbane: If I've got to go, it will be when and where I decide to go. Not her.<br>Meanwhile, I&#x2019;m not turning my back on this woman. Not for a second. If I ever disappear and someone finds this notebook, just check out Mrs. Brisbane. Please!<br>TIP ONE: Choose your new hamster's home very carefully and make sure it is secure. Hamsters are skillful "escape artists" and once out of their cages they are very difficult to find.<br>-<i>Guide to the Care and Feeding of Hamsters</i>, Dr. Harvey H. Hammer<br><br><b><br>Chapter 2: Night Life<br><br></b>For the rest of the day, I felt SAD-SAD-SAD.<br>"You look sad, Humphrey," Golden-Miranda said&nbsp;when she was cleaning my cage right before lunch.&nbsp;According to the chart Ms. Mac had left, it was her turn to take care of me, thank goodness. Miranda was the best cage-cleaner and never said "Yuck!"&nbsp;<br>She put on throwaway gloves, then cleaned my potty corner, changed my bedding, gave me fresh water and finally-oh, joy!-gave me fresh grain, some lettuce and meal worms.&nbsp;"This will make you happy," she said as she slipped me the special treat she'd brought from home: cauli�flower. Naturally, Miranda had good taste. I promptly saved it in my cheek pouch until I could store it in my sleeping house. Hamsters like to stash food for the future.&nbsp;After my cage was taken care of, I felt well enough to observe Mrs. Brisbane more carefully.&nbsp;Now, Ms. Mac was tall, wore bright blouses, short skirts and high shoes. She wore bracelets that jingled-jangled. She spoke in a loud voice and waved her arms and walked all around the room when she taught.&nbsp;<br>Mrs. Brisbane, on the other hand, was short with short gray hair. She wore dark clothes and flat shoes and she didn't jingle-jangle at all. She spoke in a voice just loud enough to hear and sat at her desk or stood at the chalkboard when she taught.&nbsp;<br>No wonder I was feeling drowsy after lunch. All that nice food and all that soft talking. "<br>Is that all this hamster does-sleep?" she asked at one point when she glanced over at my cage. "Well, he's 'turnal," replied Raise-Your-Hand-Heidi Hopper.&nbsp;<br>"Raise-Your-Hand-Heidi," said Mrs. Brisbane.&nbsp;"What's 'turnal?"&nbsp;<br>"You know. 'Turnal. He sleeps during the day," said Heidi.&nbsp;<br>I was wide-awake now. "Nocturnal," I squeaked. ''Hamsters are&nbsp;<i>nocturnal</i>."&nbsp;<br>"Oh, you mean&nbsp;<i>nocturnal</i>," said Mrs. Brisbane, almost as if she had understood me. She turned and wrote the word on the board. "Can anyone else name an animal that's nocturnal?"&nbsp;<br>"Owl," said Heidi.&nbsp;<br>"Raise-Your-Hand-Heidi," said Mrs. Brisbane. "But that is correct. An owl is nocturnal. Anyone else?"&nbsp;<br>A voice shouted out, "My dad!"&nbsp;<br>Mrs. Brisbane looked around. "Who said that?"&nbsp;<br>"He did. A.J." Garth Tugwell pointed at A.J.&nbsp;<br>Both boys sat at the table nearest to my cage.&nbsp;<br>"What about your dad?" Mrs. Brisbane asked.&nbsp;<br>A.J. squirmed in his seat. "Well, my mom always says&nbsp;my dad is nocturnal 'cause he stays up so late watching TV."&nbsp;<br>Stop-Giggling-Gail and a few other students snick�ered. Mrs. Brisbane didn't crack a smile.&nbsp;<br>"Her use of the word is correct," she said. "Though, technically, humans are not nocturnal. Any others?"&nbsp;<br>Eventually, the class came up with more names of nocturnal animals, like bats and coyotes and opossums, and Mrs. Brisbane said that the class would be learning more about animal habits later in the year.&nbsp;<br>If she'd just look at me, she could learn a lot. But I no�ticed for the rest of the day that Mrs. Brisbane stayed far away from my cage, as if I had a disease or something.&nbsp;<br>She read a mighty fine story to us in the afternoon, though. In fact, I couldn't get back to my nap afterward. It was about a scary house and these scratching noises and ... a ghost! THUMP-THUMP-THUMP, the ghost came down the hall! Oh, I had shivers and quivers.&nbsp;<br>I have to say, Mrs. Brisbane knows how to read a story. Her voice changed and her eyes got wide and I for�got about her gray hair and her dark suit. To squeak the truth, my fur was on end! The story had a funny ending because it turned out the ghost wasn't a ghost at all. It was an owl!&nbsp;<br>At the end of the story, everybody laughed. Even Mrs. Brisbane.&nbsp;<br>I was beginning to think that life with this new teacher wouldn't be so bad. But I changed my mind when the bell rang at the end of the day and all my class�mates raced out of the room, leaving me alone with her.&nbsp;<br>She erased the chalkboard and gathered up her pa�pers. I could tell that we'd be going home soon. Sud�denly, I began to worry. What if Mrs. Brisbane lived in a scary house with spooky noises and a thumping ghost?<br>Or, even worse, what is Mrs. Brisbane had a scary pet, like a dog?"<br>My mind was racing as fast as I was spinning my wheel when she finally approached and looked down at me, frowning.&nbsp;<br>"Well, you're on your own now," she said.<br>With that, she closed the blinds and walked away. But I heard her mutter "rodent" under her breath.<br>She left the classroom and closed the door.&nbsp;<br>She left me alone. All alone in Room 26.&nbsp;<br>I had never ever been alone before.<br><br>As the room slowly grew darker and quieter, I thought back to the happy times at Ms. Mac's apartment. There were always cheery lights on and music and telephone�talking and ... oh, dear, during the day I never noticed how the clock on the wall ticked off the seconds one by one very loudly.&nbsp;<br>TICK-TICK-TICK. I was feeling SICK-SICK-SICK. I wondered if there were any owls around Room 26. Or ghosts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I tried to pass the time by writing in my notebook about Pet-O-Rama and my days at Ms. Mac's apartment. Writing took my mind off my jittery nerves. But even�tually, my writing paw began to ache and I had to stop my scratchings. If only I could roam free, as I had at Ms. Mac's apartment!&nbsp;<br>Then I remembered the lock-that-doesn't-lock.<br>It only took a few seconds to jiggle the door open. I skittered across the table. Then, grasping the top of the table leg tightly, I closed my eyes and slid to the ground.&nbsp;<br>Ah, freedom! I dashed along the shiny floor. I darted between the tables and chairs. I stopped to nibble a peanut underneath Stop-Giggling-Gail's chair. It tasted delicious and made the coolest crunching sound. I chewed and chomped and gnawed and nibbled. And when I stopped ... I heard the sound.&nbsp;<br>THUMP-THUMP-THU MP.&nbsp;Just like the story Mrs. Brisbane had read us. THUMP-THUMP-THUMP.&nbsp;Closer and closer down the hall, coming toward Room 26.<br>Then RATTLE-SCRATCH. RATTLE-SCRATCH. THUMP-THUMP-THUMP.&nbsp;Suddenly, I longed f...</p><h2>Everyday Super Food</h2><p><p>This is the most personal book I've ever written, and in order to write it I've been on a complete journey through the world of health and nutrition.

Each chapter within the text's chronological organization focuses on three unique architectural cultures, giving instructors the flexibility to choose which traditions are the most relevant to their courses. The text also provides students with numerous pedagogical tools, including timelines, comparative maps, a glossary, and text boxes devoted to social factors and specific issues in technology and philosophy. The result is a compendious method for understanding and appreciating the history, cultural significance, beauty, and diversity of architecture from around the world.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Ingersoll</strong> teaches courses in Renaissance and contemporary art, architecture, and urbanism at Syracuse University in Florence, Italy.<br><br>"I am overall very satisfied with the book, I have used other text books before and found them either too encyclopedic or too summarized.

They are close, close enough, almost, to read each other&#x2019;s thoughts, but they couldn&#x2019;t be more different. Holland is bold and mischievous, a bad influence, while Niles is kind and eager to please, the sort of boy who makes parents proud. The Perrys live in the bucolic New England town their family settled centuries ago, and as it happens, the extended clan has gathered at its ancestral farm this summer to mourn the death of the twins&#x2019; father in a most unfortunate accident. Mrs. Perry still hasn&#x2019;t recovered from the shock of her husband&#x2019;s gruesome end and stays sequestered in her room, leaving her sons to roam free. As the summer goes on, though, and Holland&#x2019;s pranks become increasingly sinister, Niles finds he can no longer make excuses for his brother&#x2019;s actions. <br><br>Thomas Tryon&#x2019;s best-selling novel about a homegrown monster is an eerie examination of the darkness that dwells within everyone. It is a landmark of psychological horror that is a worthy descendent of the books of James Hogg, Robert Louis Stevenson, Shirley Jackson, and Patricia Highsmith.</p><p>Thomas Tryon (1926&#x2013;1991) was born in Hartford, Connecticut into a family whose New England roots stretch back to the seventeenth century. After serving in the navy during World War II , he attended Yale, and upon graduation began an acting career that would take him from a made-for-television Disney western to Hollywood, where he was featured in several B movies as well as Otto Preminger&#x2019;s <i>The Cardinal</i>. Preminger&#x2019;s treatment of Tryon was so cruel as to become a Hollywood legend, and Tryon turned to writing. His first book, <i>The Other </i>(1971), was an immediate success, spending more than six months on the New York Times best-seller list and allowing him to quit acting for good; a film adaptation, with a screenplay by Tryon and directed by Robert Mulligan, appeared in 1972. Tryon wrote two more novels set in the fictional Pequot Landing of <i>The Other</i>, <i>Harvest Home</i> (1973) and <i>Lady</i> (1974), before turning to works like <i>All That Glitters</i> (1986), that explore the dark side of the golden age of Hollywood. At the time of his death Tryon was working on a historical trilogy set in early nineteenth-century Connecticut.<br><br>Dan Chaon&#x2019;s most recent book is <i>Stay Awake</i>, a short-story collection. He is the author of the novels <i>You Remind Me of Me</i> and <i>Await Your Reply</i>, as well as of the story collections <i>Fitting Ends</i> and <i>Among the Missing</i>, which was a finalist for the 2001 National Book Award. His stories have appeared in <i>Best American Short Stories, The Pushcart Prize Anthologies</i>, and <i>The O. Henry Prize Stories</i>. He teaches at Oberlin College, where he is the Pauline Delaney Professor of Creative Writing and Literature.&#x201c;It is perhaps unfair and a little inaccurate to typecast <i>The Other </i>as a horror story. It is so ingenious and well-written that it transcends that&#x2014;or any&#x2014;label. The setting is the small Connecticut town of Pequot Landing, which under other circumstances, might be idyllic.&nbsp; But the people who inhabit Tryon&#x2019;s New England are just as haunted as O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s, and a lot more violent...His [Tryon&#x2019;s] characterizations have depth and subtlety, the narrative is well-paced and suspenseful. Where he really excels is with mood and atmosphere. Rarely have such commonplace surroundings been made to seem quite so dark and menacing and chillingly evil.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;A lyrical, impressive horror story that is a cross between <i>The Bad Seed </i>and John Cheever&#x2019;s <i>The Wapshot Chronicles</i>.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;This first novel from Thomas Tryon is a distinguished one, it may well leave you blenched with horror, but it is beautifully, even poetically, wrought, and within its boundaries there would seem an actual divination into the spirit of murderess insanity....In due time <i>The Other </i>will doubtless become one of the classics of horro tales, comparable to <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>.&#x201d; &#x2013; Dorothy B. Hughes <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Like most professional writers, I resent Tom Tryon&#x2019;s <i>The Other</i>, since Tryon should get on with the job of being a good actor and not write good books as well. Enough is enough already. <i>The Other </i>is a highly readable chiller.&#x201d; &#x2013; Anthony Burgess<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you're looking for a good scary book to enjoy this Halloween, here is a suggestion: <i>The Other</i> by Thomas Tryon. The 1971 horror classic is a tale of a seemingly bucolic farmhouse in a small Connecticut town in the 1930s. There are no vampires in the story, no ghosts, no swamp monsters or ghouls or zombies or witches. There are two little boys, twins Niles and Holland, the picture of innocence. Or so it seems. The story is told in the voice of one of the boys, now older and a resident of a sanitarium. Insanity, it seems, is a family inheritance, and insanity is at the core of the chilling story that slowly unfolds and culminates in some horrifying deaths.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Advocate </i>(Baton Rouge)<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Truly extraordinary! One of those books over which everybody will take leave their senses, all seven of them...&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Kirkus</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A smashing suspense-horror novel.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Minneapolis Tribune</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;A humdinger...A whirlpool of Oh-My-God horror.

Lyubomirsky argues that we have been given false promises&#x2014;myths that assure us that lifelong happiness will be attained once we hit the culturally confirmed markers of adult success. This black-and-white vision of happiness works to discourage us from recognizing the upside of any negative and limits our potential for personal growth. A corrective course on happiness and a call to regard life&#x2019;s twists and turns with a more open mind, <i>The Myths of Happiness</i> shares practical lessons that prove we are more adaptable than we think we are.

Some are burned out or bored, while others feel that professional success has eluded them. Stress over financial well-being--which for many is synonymous with professional success--is a primary source of discontent. Indeed, when people are asked if they could have anything in the world right now, most report wanting "more money.

Researchers followed high-level managers for five years to track their job satisfaction before and after a voluntary job change, such as a promotion or a relocation to a more attractive city. The managers were mostly male and white, with an average age of 45 and a $135,000 annual salary. They were doing well. What the researchers found, however, was that although these managers experienced a burst of satisfaction immediately after the job change, their satisfaction plummeted within a year, returning to their original pre-move level. In other words, they experienced a sort of hangover effect. By contrast, managers who chose not to change jobs during the same five-year time period experienced negligible changes in their satisfaction. </p> <p>We get used to the cities where we live, to new houses and new cars, to relationships, and even to sex. This capacity to adapt to positive changes in our lives is both formidable and biologically hard-wired. Even the events we are certain will bring long-term fulfillment--landing a coveted professional position, or winning an award--tend to disappoint. We feel an immediate thrill, but that thrill is often followed by satiety, elevated expectations, and even letdown. </p> <p>This is true even of monetary rewards. In the beginning, greater wealth brings us a higher standard of living, and the extravagances bring extra pleasure. But economists have found that two-thirds of the benefits of a raise in income are erased after just one year, in part because our spending and new "needs" rise alongside it and because we begin to associate with (and compare ourselves to) people in a higher income bracket. </p> <p>With so much seemingly working against long-term professional satisfaction, it&#x2019;s important to focus on where our chance for happiness truly resides. When we feel we&#x2019;ve "had it" with our jobs, should we look for job satisfaction elsewhere or is there a different path? </p> <p>Research suggests that instead of fantasizing about some dream job that doesn&#x2019;t exist, we focus on pursuing meaningful goals in the here and now. Typically, our professional lives are focused on material goals--more money, wider recognition--but numerous studies have shown that those of us who are <i>striving</i> (and not necessarily achieving) are happier. </p> <p>When it comes to our careers, if we enjoy the struggle along the way, we will derive pleasure and satisfaction by simply working on our goals. By doing so, we will ideally stretch our skills, discover novel opportunities and challenges, grow, strive, learn, and become more capable and expert. In this way, simple goal pursuit will provide us with opportunities for appreciation, for delight, and for satisfying our innate need to use our potentials to the fullest. Whether our valued goal is inventing something special or finishing school, it will give us something to work for and to look forward to.</p> <p>Why is goal pursuit so intrinsically rewarding? Because it imparts structure and meaning to our daily lives, creating obligations, deadlines, and timetables, as well as opportunities for mastering new skills and for interacting with others. Because it helps us attain a sense of purpose, feelings of efficacy over our progress, and mastery over our time. All of these things make people happy. And once we accomplish a step along the way (e.g., completing an internship or an article), we would do well to savor that accomplished subgoal before moving on to a new goal. Instead of focusing too much on the finish line in the first place, we should focus on--and enjoy as much as possible--carrying out the multiple baby steps necessary to make progress. The perfect job may not be the position offering the highest rewards, but rather the place where the daily work--the moments between the big promotion or industry triumph--offers the greatest personal returns.</p><b>Sonja Lyubomirsky</b> is a professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, and the author of <i>The How of Happiness</i> and, most recently, <i>The Myths of Happiness</i>.

In order to write, you need to get rid of notions about language, poetic form, and esoteric subject matter ? all the things that the poetry police have told you are essential if you are to write. I wanted to start from a different place, a place controlled by instinct rather than by intelligence. Revision, the shaping and honing of the poem, should come later, and, in revising, care always needs to be taken to retain the vitality and electricity of the poem. Anyone can learn to craft a capable poem, but it is the poems that retain that initial vitality that we remember; these are the poems that teach us how to be human.</p><p>When I first started to consider putting together a book about writing poetry, I thought about how frightened people often are by the idea of poetry ? writing it, reading it, feeling that they have anything to write about that anyone else would be interested in reading. I realized that my whole life as a poet and teacher was dedicated to giving people a feeling that their lives, that what they have to say, is important. I believe we all have stories to tell, and that those stories are the basis for writing poems that reach across the barriers of age, ethnicity, gender, social class to connect with all that is human inside us. I think of William Faulkner?s Nobel Prize acceptance speech in which he said: ?Writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat.?Writing Poetry to Save Your Life combines Gillan?s personal story about her journey as a writer with her suggestions for writers at all stages of development. The voice in this book is the voice of a friend who sits with you in a warm kitchen sipping espresso or a cup of herbal tea, while offering support and encouragement. It is designed to help you find the stories you have to tell and the words to tell them. It is based on the belief that when you find the courage to explore your memories, you will find the source for evocative writing. Writing Poetry to Save Your Life is a book about the writing process rather than about the craft of writing. It can be used in classrooms, by writer?s groups, or by an individual while writing at home or in a coffee shop. This book will encourage you to write, and in the process, will give you confidence, help you overcome writer?s block, and silence the critical voice of the being Gillan calls ?The Crow.? It will jumpstart your creativity, giving you permission to use the power of words to save your life.</p><h2>Women of the Dunes: A Novel</h2><p><b>A beautifully told and intriguing mystery about two generations of Scottish women united by blood, an obsession with the past, and a long-hidden body, from the author of <i>The House Between Tides.</i></b><br><br>Libby Snow has always felt the pull of Ullaness, a headland on Scotland&#x2019;s sea-lashed western coast where a legend has taken root. At its center is Ulla, an eighth-century Norsewoman whose uncertain fate was entangled with two warring brothers and a man who sought to save her. Libby first heard the stories from her grandmother, who had learned it from her own forebear, Ellen, a maid at Sturrock House.<br> <br>The Sturrocks have owned the land where Ulla dwelled for generations, and now Libby, an archaeologist, has their permission to excavate a mysterious mound, which she hopes will cast light on the legend&#x2019;s truth. But before she can begin, storms reveal the unexpected: the century-old bones of an unidentified man. The discovery triggers Libby&#x2019;s memories of family stories about Ellen, of her strange obsession with Ulla, and of her violent past at Sturrock House.<br> <br>As Libby digs deeper, she unravels a recurring story of love, tragedy, and threads that bind the past to the present. And as she learns more of Rodri Sturrock, the landowner&#x2019;s brother, she realizes these forces are still at work, and that she has her own role to play in Ulla&#x2019;s dark legend.</p><p>Sarah Maine was born in England but grew up partly in Canada before returning to the United Kingdom, where she now lives. She is the author of&nbsp;<i>The House Between Tides</i>, <i>Beyond the Wild River</i>, and <i>Women of the Dunes. </i>Women of the Dunes Chapter 1<p></p> <br> Ullaness, 2012, Libby <br> <br>When Libby Snow finally arrived, darkness was already falling. She decided to park the car anyway and walk out onto the narrow spit of land. The tide was well in and the only sound was that of the waves as they crept, hissing over the sand to the line of seaweed which marked the tide&#x2019;s turning point. Not an engine, not a voice, not a gull&#x2019;s cry. And out at sea the moon floated above the horizon, pouring silver across the dark swells and lighting the spume at the shore&#x2019;s edge.<br> <br>It had taken a long time to reach this place. Eight hours of driving&#x2014;<br> <br>Or a lifetime, depending on how you looked at it.<br> <br>The sun had set some time ago and the vibrant colours were fading in the western sky, draining away over a watery horizon; tomorrow she must make a point of being here earlier to watch it go down. March days were short, but by June, when she returned with her students, sunset would be late and lingering as long summer evenings merged with the early dawn. And once the planned dig started, there would be less time to savour such moments.<br> <br>A breeze roughened the water and she pulled her jacket close, then shut her eyes and filled her lungs, absorbing the rank smell of high-tide seaweed and salty turf. Ullaness&#x2014;a place of legend. She could almost hear Ulla&#x2019;s name whispering through the marram grasses.<br> <br>There was an awesome beauty to the place, and she looked up, seeing gulls blown landward by the wind wheeling above her, their wingtips catching the moonlight against a darkening sky. Others circled out to sea, beyond the grey shapes of distant stacks, heading for the horizon over which lay the next landfall, two thousand miles away.<br> <br>She had checked once in an atlas and been disappointed to find that if you followed the line of latitude eastwards from her grandmother&#x2019;s home on Newfoundland&#x2019;s broken coast, it went well south of Ullaness, south of Scotland in fact, to pass through the English Channel. And if you drew a line due west across the ocean from Ullaness, it fell north of that tiny Maritime harbour where she had spent her childhood summers, and went way up, above the tip of the Labrador coast, and entered the icy Hudson Strait. At the time this had seemed wrong! It should be possible to draw a line across the Atlantic, over the arc of the globe, and link the headland at Ullaness directly with Gosse Harbour, as her grandmother&#x2019;s stories had done.<br> <br>But then again, she thought, nothing in her grandmother&#x2019;s stories made a straight connection either.<br> <br>She could hardly believe she was here. The place was etched so deeply into her psyche it was almost part of her being. Familiar and yet quite unknown. She watched as a string of seabirds flying low above the ocean rose to become silhouettes against clouds now edge-lit by moonlight. What a sight! Timeless and unchanging. It must have looked the same to the nomadic people who once came here to gather shellfish, and to those who followed them and then settled, and built houses. Tides and time had sculpted the shoreline, but this view must be unaltered, and Libby felt the centuries shrink around her.<br> <br>Ulla herself must once have stood here, a thousand years ago.<br> <br>And Ellen too&#x2014;her grandmother&#x2019;s grandmother, whose stories of Ulla had been woven into Libby&#x2019;s childhood&#x2014;and she wondered again at the darker threads in the weave. Generations might divide them, but standing here now she felt herself bound by the connection to both these women, held by a sense of otherworldliness in the strange stillness of the place.<br> <br>The archaeological work planned for the summer might throw light on Ulla&#x2019;s legend, but Libby had her own reasons for being here, her own questions to ask.<br> <br>In a few hours, dawn would filter through her grandmother&#x2019;s bedroom window on the far side of the Atlantic, and the old lady would stir in her bed, emerging from under her gaily coloured quilts. As a child, in the summer holidays, Libby loved to go with her at daybreak, hand in hand, down to the fishing stages to watch the Gosse Harbour boats set off laden with crab and lobster pots, the chill morning air laced with salt and diesel. And when the boats had gone she would sit on the wooden landing, leaning her head against the mooring post, her short legs dangling, and think of the stories the old woman had told her. Of Ulla, and of Ellen who had come from Scotland, bringing the stories with her. And in her childish mind the two women had become hopelessly entangled, existing in a place she could only imagine, two thousand miles away across the ocean in Scotland.<br> <br>And Libby had felt certain that Ulla must have been as good as she was beautiful: a lovely Norsewoman, blown in on a ship by the north wind, her dying lover beside her, fleeing her husband&#x2019;s wrath. In her picture book of legends there was an illustration of the fabled Isolde, and Libby had imagined Ulla to be like her, tall and slender and very beautiful, while Odrhan, the legendary monk, would have been as handsome as the knightly Tristan. The legend of Ulla had, for Libby, been as compelling as that of those star-crossed lovers, all the more so because it was personal, as Ellen&#x2019;s stories had connected her to this place, Ullaness, where the legend had been born.<br> <br>It was only later that her grandmother had explained about Ellen&#x2019;s final years, when all was neither beautiful nor good.<br> <br>Libby rose, reminding herself that she was also here to do a job, and made an effort to bring her mind back to the present. She swept a more professional eye over the landscape, and tried to get a grip on how it all hung together. The ruined structure at her feet was Odrahn&#x2019;s cell, so they said, and, beyond the curving line of the southerly beach, she could see the roofless nave of St. Oran&#x2019;s Church, where Ellen had once worshipped. Ferns had taken root in the crumbling masonry and birds nested in niches left by fallen stones. And there, beside the church, was the abandoned manse where Ellen had worked, its broken roof slates caught in the gutters. Planks had been nailed across the door. Beyond church and manse she could see the remains of cottages, disappearing into a tangle of brambles and nettles, and wondered for a moment where Ellen might have lived. The abandoned dwellings could tell her nothing, settling back into the landscape and returning to the natural world, mute witnesses to the fact that if there had ever been a larger community here, it was long gone.<br> <br>Only Sturrock House, the landowner&#x2019;s residence, remained inhabited.<br> <br>Her gaze followed the curve of the northern beach where, somewhere amongst the sand dunes, there was the mound that they would excavate this summer. From here it looked like just another dune, but she&#x2019;d found it earlier and had stood staring down at the curved row of stones that the winter storms had exposed. It was now obviously a man-made feature, but was it a burial, and if so could it really be a physical part of the legend? Almost too much to hope for.<br> <br>There had been a frisson of excitement amongst her colleagues when the news had reached them of what had been reported following a particularly wild storm, and parallels had quickly been drawn with similar stone settings which had turned out to be graves, significant graves, boat-shaped Viking-age graves&#x2014;and there had been general agreement that the site should be excavated before the evidence was lost. Despite her own attachment to it, the legend of Ullaness had never been in the same league as that of Tristan and Isolde, but it did, after all, refer explicitly to the burial of a Viking warrior.<br> <br>Professor Declan Lockhart, an early medievalist at the midlands university where Libby had a short-term contract, had been assigned to the project and an advertisement had gone out for an assistant to help him run it. For Libby, the job was custom-made, and she had applied. She&#x2019;d not mentioned her personal connection at the interview, nor had she mentioned her grandmother&#x2019;s stories when she was offered the post. They had, after all, no bearing on the ancient site.<br> <br>She moved off, back along the causeway. Tomorrow she would inspect the mound in daylight, putting the personal aspects aside, and start to think seriously about the summer. A unique opportunity to match archaeological investigation with the surviving oral tradition and ancient legend, their grant application had stated.<br> <br>And, for Libby, a career-making opportunity which must go well.<br> <br>That thought collided, as it had done all week, with the acute worry about the parcel which had arrived last Saturday from Gosse Harbour. She had opened it to find it contained an old sketchbook which she remembered from childhood, and she had thumbed through it, seeing the drawings she&#x2019;d been told were Ellen&#x2019;s, and smiled at her own scribblings added on wet summer days. A fragment of the legend had been written on the back page, but as she turned to it an object, wrapped in a slip of paper, had slid out from between the pages and onto her lap. This was Ellen&#x2019;s, her grandmother had written on the paper. A trinket, she&#x2019;d thought, as she carefully unwrapped it, and then stared down at the object in astonishment.<br> <br>It was a cross about four inches across with four splayed arms, each decorated with a simple circular design while in the centre a larger incised circle framed a deep red stone, and the object seemed to glow against her skin. Gold? Carefully she turned it over, seeing how one of the arms had been folded over to make a loop through which a thong could be threaded so that the cross became a pendant. A simple design, but skilled craftsmanship, and her heart had started to pound as she recognised it for the real thing. An ancient artefact redolent of the early days of Christianity and the emergent northern church. It could only be gold, thin, hand-beaten gold, and the stone was almost certainly a garnet, a stone once much prized. Gold and garnet. The sort of thing that would be owned by an early bishop or other high-ranking churchman, or a devout layman&#x2014;eighth century in date, if she was right.<br> <br>So how had Ellen come by it? It was worth thousands.<br> <br>She looked anxiously across towards Sturrock House. Over the years items had gone missing from there, it was said, valuable antiquities&#x2014;<br> <br>And she found herself wondering what else might have found its way to Gosse Harbour. The letter which arrived with the parcel had simply said: Ellen used to wear it, my dear, so I thought you&#x2019;d like to have it. Libby had written straight back asking what else her grandmother could tell her about it, where it had come from, were there other items . . . ? But she had, as yet, had no reply. It was letters, stamps, and patience with Nan, not e-mail.<br> <br>She looked again at the house. The cross had almost certainly come from there, but in what circumstances, and how on earth was she to broach the subject? And with whom? The house was set back within a garden bordered by a stone perimeter wall, masked by a line of shrubs and trees, and all she could see of it in the growing darkness was the roof, a silhouette of little turrets and chimneys. A right old mishmash of architectural styles and now the home of the seventh baronet, Sturrock of Ullaness.<br> <br>It had started life as a late medieval tower house, she had read, and developed from there, with successive extensions and alterations reaching a crescendo in the nineteenth century embellishments of the third baronet. He had, by all accounts, embraced the Romantic movement with well-funded gusto and positioned himself in something of a dream world, rooted in the works of Walter Scott.<br> <br>The family was at home, she noted, seeing thin grey smoke spiralling above the rooftops. Perhaps, in the summer, there would be an opportunity to have a look inside, but on this visit, for all sorts of reasons&#x2014;not least the arrival of the little cross&#x2014;Libby intended to stay well below the radar.<br> <br><br> <br>Declan had had all the dealings with the Sturrock estate, and had found them unhelpful and remote; it had taken forever to agree on terms for the excavation. The estate had refused to contribute a penny towards the project, and numerous conditions had been stipulated and legal contracts insisted upon. Uphill work, Declan had said.<br> <br>Libby had thought right from the start that it would have been better to come up here and deal with matters face-to-face, but Declan was a busy man, and he did not delegate, especially to a newly appointed assistant. Nor did he take advice. The baronet himself was impossible to contact, he said, so why go up to talk to an intermediary? It had taken time, therefore, and a lot of backwards and forwards of e-mails and letters to get all the paperwork in place and all appropriate bodies satisfied. In the end they had had to settle for a much less ambitious project than Declan had first envisaged, and had only secured permission to excavate the mound itself and do a building survey of the roofless church. All correspondence had to be directed to the estate&#x2019;s owner, Sir Hector Sturrock, but all negotiations were undertaken with his intractable land agent, who, Declan had told her, was uncooperative. Sir Hector himself remained unavailable.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d been in Declan&#x2019;s office when he had phoned and tried one last time to persuade the agent to let them excavate the enigmatic ruins at the end of the headland and dig a few small test pits in the bay area. It would enhance their understanding of the ancient landscape, he explained down the phone, rolling his eyes at Libby.

Homesteading is also a memoir of my journey of recovering from C-PTSD. Written in a more playful, easier to read style than my other books, it is much less dense and relatively free of psychological jargon. Several previewers have described it as rich, poignant, funny and full of self-disclosive anecdotes that are sure to help other survivors in their recovery. &#34;Homesteading&#34; has two parts. In Part I, I escape from my dysfunctional family and backpack around the world seeking happiness while I unconsciously flee my suffering. In Part II, I wander into the jungles of psychological theory and technique. I shift my focus from global adventurer to inner world explorer. The many hits and misses of my recovery efforts are detailed in this book. Eventually, I discover what works, and gradually move from struggling to survive to discovering how to thrive. Very gradually I find meaning, belonging and fulfillment. My fear shrinks, my toxic shame melts away, and peace of mind becomes my touchstone. My psyche heals as my self-kindness, self-care, and self-protection continuously grow. Eventually, I break the pattern of being attracted to painful relationships that mirror my experiences with my parents. This in turn frees me to find a number of truly intimate and comforting relationships.</p><p>Pete Walker, M.A., MFT, is a licensed Marriage and Family psychotherapist with degrees in Social Work and Counseling Psychology. He has been working as a counselor, lecturer, writer and group leader for forty years, and as a trainer, supervisor and consultant of other therapists for 20 years. He holds certificates in supervision from The California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists and from The Psychotherapy Institute in Berkeley. Pete Walker is a "general practitioner" who has a private practice in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. He specializes in helping adults who were traumatized in childhood, especially those whose repeated exposure to abuse and/or neglect left them with the symptoms of Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder [Cptsd]. His articles on a multimodal approach to treating Cptsd have been published in a number of professional psychotherapy periodicals. Pete&#x2019;s first book, The Tao of Fully Feeling: Harvesting Forgiveness Out of Blame, has been acclaimed by many therapists and clients as a powerful, compassionate and pragmatic tool for guiding recovery. Alice Miller, author of The Drama of the Gifted Child, wrote: &#x201c;Pete Walker wrote a book about his own recovery from emotional numbness. The author passionately explores as thoroughly as possible the role of emotions in human life. The result is not only a moving, honest recount but also an informative guide for people who want to become more aware of their buried feelings. Walker's well explained concept of 'reparenting' will help them go through this fascinating process in a safe, protected way." Pete&#x2019;s second book, Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving, is the logical extension and evolution of the work presented in his first book. It deeply explores the causes of Cptsd that range from severe neglect to monstrous abuse. Many survivors of traumatizing families grew up in houses that were not homes &#x2013; in families that were as loveless as orphanages and sometimes as dangerous. Complex PTSD : From Surviving To Thriving is a comprehensive, user-friendly, self-help guide to recovering from the lingering effects of childhood trauma. It is an overview of the tasks of recovering, and an illumination of the silver linings that can come out of effective recovery work. It contains a great many practical tools and techniques for recovering from Cptsd. It is also copiously illustrated with examples of his own and others&#x2019; journeys of recovering.</p><h2>Growing in Gratitude: Rediscovering the Joy of a Thankful Heart</h2><p>As women, we are often encouraged to "count our blessings." But truly biblical gratitude is much more than this.<br><br> Mary K. Mohler unpacks Scripture to help us grow in gracious gratitude (thanking God for who he is) as well as natural gratitude (thanking him for his blessings) and to identify and deal with some of the things that hinder us to help us rediscover the joy of a thankful heart.<br><br> This thoroughly Bible centered unpacking of the reasons for gratitude builds on Mary K. Mohler's 25 years experience in mentoring seminary wives at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. <br><br> Discussion questions at the end of each chapter make this book ideal for group use as well as for individuals.</p><p>Mary K. Mohler serves in ministry as the president&#39;s wife at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, and as the founder and director of Seminary Wives Institute, an academic program for student wives at Southern Seminary and Boyce College.<i>Growing in Gratitude</i> is a must read for anyone who has ever doubted, suffered or just plain coasted in life. Starting in the Garden of Eden and continuing throughout the whole span of Scripture, Mary Mohler invites us to embrace the big-dealness of gratitude for those who know Christ. In straightforward, yet deeply penetrating ways, Mary opens the theological doorway to a grateful heart as graciously as she has opened the door of her home to thousands throughout her years of ministry. With perceptive illustrations, she skillfully wins us over until we are abounding in thanksgiving (Colossians 2:7) in happy obedience to God s Word. This book would be a treasure if only for the truth found in her list of Ten Ways to Thank the Lord When it Hurts. But read the whole thing! Both your head and your heart will be lifted up into new paths of gratitude.<br> --<b>Jani Ortlund</b>, Executive Vice President, Renewal Ministries<br><br>Popular mottos and self-help advice on being thankful abound. But Mary K. Mohler takes us deeper to explore the theological root of gratitude and the hindrances that keep us from developing a truly grateful heart. In this book, you'll find solid, effective counsel. So listen up! I'm confident you'll be grateful you did.<br> --<b>Mary A. Kassian</b>, Author, <i>Girls Gone Wise</i><br><br> Mary Mohler bares her lovely and redeemed heart in this book. And as I read it, I found myself scribbling notes, making book lists from Mary's recommendations, and stopping to pray in both repentance and thanksgiving. I did this because I want the habits and heart of this book to seep into my own. Simple but not simplistic, profound but not inaccessible, this book shows how Christian gratitude, more than list-making and positive thinking, nourishes believers to become more like our Savior, preparing us to be conduits for his grace. As I was reading this book, I felt like I was sitting with Mary in her kitchen, listening, learning, praying, and thanking God for the unity and beauty and power of the gospel to equip us, truly, to every good work, including the good work of thanking him when agonizing circumstances do not change. Although written for women, all Christians will benefit from this book.<br> --<b>Rosaria Butterfield</b>, Author of <i>The Secret Thoughts of an Unlikely Convert</i> and <i>Openness Unhindered</i><br><br> Gratitude is a lost art in our entitled and consumeristic society. Even in the church we have lost a sense of thankfulness for not only what we have, but also for all that God has done for us in Christ. Mary Mohler exhorts us to fight that tendency, and she does so with care and with insight. I was convicted and encouraged to not only grow in my gratitude towards the Lord, but also to pass on this legacy to my children. This book is a gift to God's people, who must learn to not forget all his benefits. <br> --<b>Courtney Reissig</b>, Author of <i>Glory in the Ordinary</i> and <i>The Accidental Feminist</i><br><br>Gratitude isn t an autumn attitude. As Mary Mohler explains, it is a deeply theological emotion that shapes and reveals our heart for God in every season of life. We are grateful to God for this insightful book that helps us all to see the gravity and the grace of gratitude.<br> --<b>Carolyn Mahaney and Nicole Whitacre</b>, Authors, <i>True Beauty</i> and <i>True Feelings</i><br><br> <i>Growing in Gratitude</i> by Mary K. Mohler is an informative and inspiring volume on what has become a vanishing virtue for this entitled generation. Mohler reminds us that the movement from grace to gratitude to giving is a divine mandate worthy of our most diligent efforts even in the midst of personal challenges and suffering. Even as your thorn list runs parallel to your praise list, you must choose to focus on the Lord and His power and love more than on your own pain and difficulty!<br> --<b>Dorothy Kelley Patterson</b>, Professor of Theology in Women s Studies, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Fort Worth, TX<br><br> Entitlement is the death of gratitude, and so no wonder our age is awash in unthankfulness. By contrast, the Christian life is a life of gratitude (how could it be otherwise when we are saved by God s grace alone!), but being thankful is easier said than done through all the changing scenes of life, in trouble and in woe. Mary Mohler addresses this vital subject here, positively helping us grow in gratitude as she points us to God s Word. I m thankful for Mary, and I m thankful for her study of Bible-based, grace-empowered thankfulness in this book, <i>Growing in Gratitude</i>, and her encouragement of us in it!<br> --<b>Ligon Duncan</b>, Chancellor and CEO, Reformed Theological Seminary<br><br> With penetrating insight, Mary Mohler provides a thoughtful and thorough study of Biblical gratitude and the necessity for each of us to grow in this area. She speaks with conviction and clarity, with humility and humor. I strongly recommend this Scripture-saturated, theologically robust, and eminently practical book.<br> --<b>Jodi Ware</b>, Wife, mother, grandmother, and faculty member of the Seminary Wives Institute at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br> <i>Growing in Gratitude</i> gives fresh and carefully applied insights into a familiar topic. The up-to-date observations (e.g. the impact smartphones are having on our social interactions) coupled with well explained quotes from historic giants in the faith make this a very helpful and timely reminder that we have every reason to be thankful. It was a real joy to listen to Mary's wisdom from years of learning thankfulness. There is helpful application throughout and I loved the fact that she encouraged us to stop and pray, putting into action what we're learning. Each chapter has just two study questions at the end a valuable and manageable tool to help us think further, or study with friends. I found Mary's chapters on hindrances to gratitude fresh and insightful. I have been challenged by her shrewd observations, and genuinely can say this book has helped me to be growing in gratitude. <br> --<b>Linda Allcock</b>, London Women's Convention</p><h2>Hamster Princess: Little Red Rodent Hood</h2><p><b>It's Little Red Riding Hood as you've never seen her before in this funny, feminist spin on the fairy tale, from award-winning author Ursula Vernon</b><br><br>Most monsters know better than to mess with Princess Harriet Hamsterbone.

Poetic descriptions suggest the sounds of the instruments, and lively watercolor illustrations capture the playful essence of each musician and musical instrument. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a smashing introduction to classical music, and a must prior to a first visit to the symphony.&#x201d;--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br></p><p>Writer and artist Ann Hayes grew up near Chicago, graduated from the University of Chicago, and studied at the Art Institute there.<br> &nbsp;Kindergarten-Grade 3-- An attractive, well-planned book that introduces the orchestra's families (groups of like instruments) and its members. In clear and understandable prose, each instrument's function, especially as it relates to the other members of its family, and its sound are described in sometimes poetic phrases--"its song can be bright as laughter, light as air, soft as a whisper, or sad as a tear." Single- or double-page spreads feature a large watercolor illustration of an animal playing the instrument under discussion. Although most are aptly chosen for their instruments--a polar bear playing a bassoon and a lion as the conductor--some are disconcerting. The sight of a chimpanzee in a pink dress and frilly pantaloons sitting at a grand piano lessens the effectiveness of that instrument's description. Overall, however, these creatures add a lively note and enable the book to be friendly and accessible without exhibiting the overriding silliness found in Eugen's Orchestranimals (Scholastic, 1989). A good book to use in the classroom as well as individually, this is a collaboration between two artists whose love for music and the orchestra is evident throughout. --Jane Marino, White Plains Pub .

Overcoming the 9 Toxic Thought Patterns that Get in the Way of a Loving Relationship</h2><p>Most people think that poor communication is the reason why so many relationships end, but it&#39;s actually the way we learn to think about our partners and our problems that kills trust, erodes intimacy, and cripples communication. In Why Can&#39;t You Read My Mind?, psychologist Jeffrey Bernstein reveals-for the first time-the nine toxic thought patterns at work in virtually every relationship, and shows couples how these distorted, negative, exaggerated thoughts can poison their love and end their union. With warmth and wisdom, Bernstein offers a simple yet powerful approach for breaking the toxic thinking cycle and helps readers establish new and more positive thinking habits for solving their problems and dealing with the stresses of everyday life. Packed with practical advice and valuable insights, Why Can&#39;t You Read My Mind? makes it possible for couples to remain in or return to loving relationships permanently, and points the way toward finding a truer kind of love with one another for the first time. Perfect for couples wanting to maintain their loving relationship as well as for those working to restore their love, this book provides the missing link, enabling couples to beat the relationship odds and sustain a long-term relationship.</p><p>Jeffrey Bernstein, Ph.D., is a licensed psychologist specializing in couples and family therapy in the Philadelphia area. He has spent the last two years conducting seminars for couples using his discoveries about the toxic thinking problem in relationships, and has helped hundreds of couples on the brink of separation and divorce think their way back to love. SUSAN MAGEE is an award-winning writer of fiction and nonfiction and co-author of several books, including <i>The Power of Positive Confrontation</i> and <i>When the Little Things Count.</i> Bernstein and Magee live with their families outside Philadelphia.Bernstein, a psychologist specializing in couples and family therapy, and Magee (The Power of Positive Confrontation) offer partners a way to renew the spark in their relationships in this succinct self-help guide. They claim that one of the most significant steps is to focus on yourself rather than your partner by ridding yourself of toxic thoughts, "negative thoughts that have lost their basis in reality and have gotten out of control." Examining nine toxic thought patterns (such as jumping to conclusions, labeling one another and playing the "blame game"), the authors provide well-researched explanations, relevant examples and practical alternatives to transform negative thoughts and behaviors into positive and constructive ones. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Intimidation and fear were central to the system of oppression in most of the Deep South. To overcome the system of segregation, Black people had to overcome fear to present a significant challenge to White domination. As the civil rights movement developed, armed self-defense and resistance became a significant means by which the descendants of enslaved Africans overturned fear and intimidation and developed different political and social relationships between Black and White Mississippians.</p><br><p>This riveting historical narrative reconstructs the armed resistance of Black activists, their challenge of racist terrorism, and their fight for human rights.</p></p><p><b>Akinyele Omowale Umoja</b> is Professor and Chair of the Department of African-American studies at Georgia State University, where he teaches courses on the history of the civil rights and Black Power movements and other social movements. He has been a community activist for over 40 years."Timely and timeless. . . . Expands our understanding of the hidden narratives of Mississippi's black armed resistance groups scattered through generations." (Kathleen Cleaver,Senior Lecturer and Research Fellow, Emory Law School)<br><br>"Akinyele Umojas marvelously rich and exhaustive study of Mississippi will radically transform the debate about the role of nonviolence within the civil rights movement, proving that armed self-defense actually saved lives, reduced terrorist attacks on African American communities, and laid the foundation for unparalleled community solidarity. We Will Shoot Back is decidedly not a romantic celebration of gun culture, but a sometimes sobering, sometimes beautiful story of self-reliance and self-determination and a peoples capacity to sustain a movement against all odds." (Robin D. G. Kelley,author of Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination)<br><br>"This riveting historical narrative relies upon oral history, archival material, and scholarly literature to reconstruct the use of armed resistance by Black activists and supporters in Mississippi to challenge racist terrorism, segregation, and fight for human rights and political empowerment from the early 1950s through the late 1970's." (Mark Anthony Neal)<br><br>"Umoja has contributed to a more complex and less romanticized understanding of the civil rights movement by documenting civil rights tactics difficult to hail in &amp; beloved community tones: the deployment of coercion toward the very people the movement meant to free from coercion." (<i>American Quarterly</i>)<br><br>"Umoja follows confrontation in communities across the state through the ends of the 1970s, demonstrating how black Mississippians were ultimately able to overcome intimidation by mainstream society, defeat legal segregation, and claim a measure of political control of their state." (<i>The Clarion-Ledger</i>)<br><br>"[B]y extending the narrative of armed resistance through the late 1970s and emphasizing grassroots activism, this well-researched and beautifully written book succeeds in pushing historiographical boundaries. It will undoubtedly be of interest to scholars and students alike." (<i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>"[Umoja] asserts that armed resistance played a significant role in the Mississippi Black Freedom Struggle, providing a useful corrective to the assumption that southern blacks were passive in response to white terror and the Ku Klux Klan. . . . Umoja's greatest contribution is to tell the stories of the less well-known black Mississippians who had the courage to confront White racism and fight back. . . . Their stories and legacy provide an essential correction to the stereotype of indigenous southern black passivity perpetuated by such popular Hollywood fare as Mississippi Burning (1988)." (<i>Journal of American Culture</i>)<br><br>"The book is meticulously researched and easily accessible. Part of a wider trend toward understanding social movements through targeted community studies and oral histories, Umoja's scholarship has contributed to a deeper, richer, and ultimately more accurate understanding of the civil rights/black power movement(s). The stereotype of cowering black sharecroppers, awaiting the intervention of well-meaning white do-gooders to rescue them from virulent Klansmen, cannot withstand the withering fire of We Will Shoot Back." (Christopher Strain <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"In We Will Shoot Back, Umoja presents a compelling and important argument for the role of armed resistance played in the Mississippi freedom struggle. . . . He successfully challenges the often silent narrative on the importance and prevalence of armed resistance in Mississippi and, in doing so, We Will Shoot Back underscores the importance of reexamining the Mississippi movement in all of its complexities." (<i>Register of the Kentucky Historical Society</i>)<br><br>"InWe Will Shoot Back, historian Akinyele Omowale Umoja adds his voice to the flurry of recent scholarship that examines the relationship between armed self-defense and nonviolent protest in the black freedom struggle. Umoja Succeeds in his quest to enshrine a tradition of militant self-defense within Mississippis black freedom struggle."

Brown and William Edward Morris</p> <p><br></p> <p>David Hume (1711&#x2013;1776) was the most important philosopher ever to write in English, as well as a master stylist. This volume contains his major philosophical works. <em>A</em> <em>Treatise of Human Nature </em>(1739&#x2013;1740), published while Hume was still in his twenties, consists of three books on the understanding, the passions, and morals. It applies the experimental method of reasoning to human nature in a revolution that was intended to make Hume the Newton of the moral sciences. Disappointed with the <em>Treatise</em>&#x2019;s failure to bring about such a revolution, Hume later recast Book I as <em>An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</em> (1751), and Book III as <em>An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals</em>, which he regarded as &#x2018;incomparably the best&#x2019; of all his works. Both <em>Enquiries</em> went through several editions in his lifetime. </p> <p>Hume&#x2019;s works, controversial in his day, remain deeply and widely influential in ours, especially for his contributions to our understanding of the nature of morality, political and economic theory, philosophy of religion, and philosophical naturalism.</p> <p>This volume also includes Hume&#x2019;s anonymous <em>Abstract</em> of Books I and II of the <em>Treatise</em>, and the short autobiographical essay, &#x2018;My Own Life&#x2019;, which he wrote just before his death.</p></p><p>David Hume (1711-1776) is one of the most important British philosophers, essayists, and historians of the eighteenth century.

The vehicle&#x2019;s driver, absorbed in texting while driving, plowed right into Rynes, dragging her under the SUV until bystanders intervened.</p><p>Suffering from severe spinal and head injuries, Rynes knew she was dying. At that moment, she underwent the first of two life-changing near-death experiences&#x2014;her consciousness split between her frightened, injured self laying on the road, and an impartial, peaceful observer-consciousness who watched as first responders fought to keep her alive. Her second, more lengthy near-death experience (NDE) came days later, during the surgery to repair her traumatized spine. </p><p>Rynes, a scientist and confirmed skeptic, was shown the wonders of Heaven, experiencing joy, love, and beauty on such a grand scale that she wept at its magnitude. She then met and spoke with a Being who gave her insights into life, love, and the wonders of Spirit. After her tour of Heaven, she was returned to her body to begin the long, slow process of recovering from injuries her surgeon affirms should have killed her. </p><p>In <i>Awakenings from the Light</i>, Rynes recounts the amazing sights of Heaven, and explains the remarkable insights into life she returned with to share with others. She was gifted with a second chance&#x2014;a precious opportunity to bring a little bit of Heaven into her life on Earth. The wisdom she passes on could well change your life as well.</p><p><i>&#x201c;You have expressed your story so clearly, and positively that I can feel that love floating off the page. Bless you. &#x201c; Richard V.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Nancy, thank you for sharing this. I have heard a number of NDEs before but have believed none to this point primarily because they were told by attention seekers. I don't believe that is the case here. I've never heard it explained so well...Thank you for bolstering my faith.&#x201d; Lou B. </i></p></p><p><p>Nancy Rynes was raised on a small farm near Woodstock, Illinois and is currently a writer and artist residing near Boulder, Colorado.</p> <p>Born Roman Catholic, Rynes became an atheist, and later an agnostic, beginning in her late teens when she went to university to study geology and archaeology. While she began her education as an artist at Chicago's American Academy of Art, she went on to earn a BSc in geology from Northern Illinois University, then attended the University of Colorado, Boulder, for Masters-level coursework. The sciences taught her to base her views only on things that were measurable. Since Spirit was not measurable, it did not exist in her view.</p> <p>The skepticism remained until January of 2014 when Spirit gave Rynes a wake-up call in the form of a tragic accident. Since her near-death experience, she has returned to a more spiritual and creative life based on the wisdom she learned in Heaven.</p> <p>In the past, Rynes has been an archeological artist, geologist, and data analyst, and science/technical writer. But then Heaven threw her a curveball, one she feels she desperately needed. Now, she writes books about Spirit, what happens when we die, and how we can bring a little bit of "Heaven" to our lives on Earth.</p></p><h2>The Secret to Hummingbird Cake</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;<em>The Secret to Hummingbird Cake </em>celebrates strong women and stronger ties.

Happiness tends to be cast as a fluffy emotion without substance rather than a biblical concept, but this is not theologically accurate. Wearing the twin hats of both seminarian and belly-laughing adoptive mom, Lisa Harper dismantles the old-school idea that joy, not happiness, is the truly spiritual emotion, and asserts that Christ-followers are actually <i>called</i> to happiness.<br> &nbsp;<br> We are called to happiness, and this happiness is not impacted by personal or global tumult. In fact, happiness is a sacrament. The general definition of <i>sacrament</i> is &#x201c;a visible sign of inward grace.&#x201d; In communities of faith, it most often refers to holy communion or the Eucharist. In the broadest understanding, however, a sacrament is a gift bestowed by God, and in that case, &#x2018;happiness&#x2019; is absolutely a sacrament&#x2014;a visible, sometimes even audible, sign of inward grace!<br> &nbsp;<br> Lisa shares heart-wrenching difficult stories from her past, as well as some side-splitting hilarity along the way. Throughout the book, we see that happiness and sadness can coexist and ebb and flow like the tides.<br> &nbsp;<br> Christine Caine, Founder of A21 &amp; Propel Women, had this to say about Lisa&#x2019;s new book: "<i>The Sacrament of Happy</i>&#x2014;like all of Lisa&#x2019;s messages and books&#x2014;enriches my understanding of God and His Word&#x2014;and His great love for us.

Along the way he encounters Ram Dass and Richard Gere, and dialogues with leading rabbis and Jewish thinkers, including Zalman Schacter, Yitz and Blue Greenberg, and a host of religious and disaffected Jews and Jewish Buddhists. </p><p> This amazing journey through Tibetan Buddhism and Judaism leads Kamenetz to a renewed appreciation of his living Jewish roots.</p></p><p><p>Roger Kamenetz wrote the landmark international bestseller, <em>The Jew in the Lotus</em>, and the winner of the National Jewish Book Award, <em>Stalking Eljah</em>. He is a Louisiana State University Distinguished Professor of English and Religious Studies and a certified dream therapist. He lives in New Orleans with his wife, fiction writer Moira Crone.</p>A personal journey of Jewish spiritual renewal in dialogue with the Dalai Lama. Summoned by the Dalai Lama to Dharamsala, the retreat in northern India that the Tibetan exile community has inhabited since the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1959, a group of eight Jewish leaders goes to India for a week of discussions in order to teach the Tibetan spiritual leader what the Jewish tradition has learned about religious self-preservation. Jewish poet and designated eyewitness Kamenetz (English/Louisiana Univ.) comes along for the ride and on the way learns about the richness of his own Jewish identity by hearing about its similarities to Tibetan Buddhism. Familiar with survival in the face of exile and near-annihilation, the Jewish leaders, mostly rabbis, communicate their wisdom to the Dalai Lama. While we are prepared for a two-way exchange, Kamenetz tells us mostly about the rich, contradictory life of modern Judaism: from the Orthodox Irving (``Yitz'') and Blu Greenberg, who are concerned with maintaining the purity of religious observance, to the kabbalistic Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, who, as a leader of the Reconstructionist movement, unites the esoteric traditions of Jewish mysticism with a post-1960s eclecticism. At the heart of the book is an exchange between Schachter-Shalomi and the Dalai Lama about the nature of angels and reincarnation, during which the Jews and Buddhists present realize the close parallels between their traditions. The large number of ``JUBUs,'' Jewish Buddhists (including Allen Ginsberg) Kamenetz encounters leads him to question the problem of some American Jews' conversion to Buddhism in response to what they perceived as Judaism's closed spiritual door. But as the reader discovers, the Jewish esoteric tradition, including specific spiritual practices such as meditation, is available to the ardent seeker. A highly entertaining personal account of one man's surprising journey into the mystical heart of Judaism. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Oxford scientist Richard Dawkins is among Darwin's chief defenders, and an able one indeed-- witty, literate, capable of turning a beautiful phrase. In <i>River Out of Eden</i> he introduces general readers to some fairly abstract problems in evolutionary biology, gently guiding us through the tangles of mitochondrial DNA and the survival-of-the- fittest ethos. (Superheroes need not apply: Dawkins writes, "The genes that survive . . . will be the ones that are good at surviving in the average environment of the species.") Dawkins argues for the essential unity of humanity, noting that "we are much closer cousins of one another than we normally realize, and we have many fewer ancestors than simple calculations suggest."Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist renowned throughout the world. He was educated at Oxford and taught zoology before becoming the first holder of the Charles Simonyi Chair of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University, in 1995. His previous books rank among the most influential intellectual works of our time. They include THE SELFISH GENE (1976), RIVER OUT OF EDEN (1995), and UNWEAVING THE RAINBOW (1999).</p><h2>Steven Universe Vol. 1 (Steven Universe, 1)</h2><p>BELIEVE IN STEVEN!<br><br>Steven Universe is just your normal Beach City citizen...who is anything by normal!

He became a widely respected lawyer after completing law school at just sixteen, but later left his practice to give his salvation more attention. Alphonsus joined the Oratory of St. Philip Neri as a seminarian and was ordained in 1726, when he was thirty. The powerful homilies he gave were known for their profound ability to convert those who had fallen away from the faith. He also founded the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer and authored works such as <i>The Glories of Mary</i>, <i>The True Spouse of Jesus Christ</i>, <i>Attaining Salvation</i>, <i>The Blessed Virgin Mary</i>, <i>Preparation for Death Abridged</i>, <i>What Will Hell Be Like?</i>, <i>The Twelve Steps to Holiness and Salvation</i>, and <i>The Way of the Cross</i>.<br> After being a bishop for over a decade, St. Alphonsus Liguori died on the first of August, 1787. He was canonized by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839 and declared a Doctor of the Church in 1871. His feast is celebrated on August 1.</p><h2>100 Ways to Love Your Husband: The Simple, Powerful Path to a Loving Marriage</h2><p>Couples with great marriages know one simple truth: the best marriages are made up of many everyday decisions that say, "I love you" rather than those that say, "I love me."

Another twelve feet were expected soon and tomorrow would be colder. At the intersection of Tauvinskaya and Smarkandskaya streets, near the petrol tanks, not far from the Barrikady Factory, the boulevards were empty of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, though arms, legs, feet shod and unshod, hands gloved and ungloved, even a head or two stuck out of the caked white banks that lined them. A dead dog could be seen there, a dead old lady here. The sky was low and gray, threatening; columns of smoke rose from various energetic encounters in the northern suburb of Spartaskovna a few miles away. A ruined Sd. Kfz 251, painted frosty white for camouflage, lay on its side, its visible track sheared, a splatter of steel wheels all over the street. Its crew had either escaped or been long since devoured by feral dogs and rats. Farther down rusted away a T-34 without a turret, a relic of warmer months, as was presumably its crew. On either side of either street for blocks on end, the buildings had been reduced to devastation and resembled a maze, a secret puzzle of shattered brick, twisted steel, blackened wall, ruptured vehicle. In this labyrinth, small groups of men hunted each other and now and then would spring an ambush and a spasm of rifle or machine-gun fire would erupt, perhaps the blast of a Russian or German grenade. Occasionally a plane would roar overhead, a Sturmovik or a Stuka, like a predator bird looking for something to kill and eat.<br> <br>But for now, the intersection was quiet, though a riot of snow-flakes floated downward, swirling in the wind, covering bloodstains, human entrails, fecal deposits, muffling the screams of men who&#x2019;d lost legs or testicles, the whole panopoly of total, bitter war fought at very close quarters in frozen conditions, under a gossamer surface of silky frost.<br> <br>One man, however, was quite warm and comfortable. He was prone-positioned in what had been Apartment 32, 27 Smarkandskaya Street, a model Soviet worker&#x2019;s building, which now had no roof and few walls. He lay belly-down on three blankets, under three blankets. His face was smeared with zinc ointment as a protection against frostbite, his hands were twice gloved, a white hood engulfed most of his head, and a scarf sheathed his mouth and nose, so that only the eyes, dark behind snow goggles, were visible. Best of all, every half an hour, a private would slither up the stairs and slip a hot water bottle under the blankets, its contents freshly charged from a boiling pot two flights below.<br> <br>The prone man was named Gunther Ramke and he was a feldwebel, a sergeant, in the 3rd Battalion of the Second Regiment of the 44th Infantry Division in XI Corps in the Sixth Army under Paulus, facing the 13th Guards Rifle Division of the Soviet 62nd Army under Zhukov as the heavy fighting of Operation Uranus echoed in the distance. Zhukov was trying desperately to encircle Paulus as a preliminary to destroying him and his three hundred thousand colleagues. None of that mattered to Feldwebel Ramke, who had no imagination for any kind of pictures save the one he saw through his Hensoldt Dialytan four-power telescopic sight, set in a claw mount on his Mauser K98k.<br> <br>He was a sniper, he was hunting a sniper. That was all.<br> <br>The Russian had moved in a few weeks ago, a very talented stalker and shooter, and already had eliminated seven men, two of them SS officers. It was thought that the fellow had worked the Barrikady Factory zone before that, and possibly Memomova Hill. He liked to kill SS. It wasn&#x2019;t that Ramke had any particular investment in the SS, which struck him as ridiculous (he was farm-raised and thought the black costumes were something for the stage or cinema; additionally, he knew nothing of politics except that the Fatherland had been starved into submission in &#x2019;18, then gotten screwed in the Treaty of Versailles), but he was a good soldier, an excellent shot (twenty-nine kills), and he had an assignment and meant to bring it off. It would keep his captain happy, and life was better for everyone in the company, as in all armies that have ever existed anywhere in the world at any time, if the captain was happy.<br> <br>He knew this game was of a dimension he had not yet encountered. Normally you stalk, you slither, you pop up or dip down, and sooner or later a fellow with a Mosin-Nagant or a Red tommy gun comes your way, you settle into position, hold your breath, steady the weapon on bones not muscles, watch the crosshair ooze toward center body, and squeeze. The fellow staggers and falls; or he steps back and falls; or he simply falls; but it always ends in the fall. Plop, to the ground, raising dust or snow, followed by the eternal stillness known only to the dead.<br> <br>But the character on the other side of the street was too good. So the new rules were, you never moved. You emulated the recently deceased. You never looked up or about. Your field of vision was your battlefield, and it covered about thirty feet at 250 meters. You stayed disciplined. The rifle was loaded and cocked so there was no ritual of bolt throw, with its bobbing head and flying elbows, either of which could get you killed. The name of this game was patience. The opponent would come to you. It was a question of waiting. Thus, Gunther was perfectly constituted for the job, being barely literate and lacking any ability to project himself in time or space. He was the ideal sniper: what was, was; he had no need for speculation, delusion, curiosity, or fantasy.<br> <br>He was set up to cover the fifth and sixth floors of a much-battered apartment building across the street and the traffic circle that marked the intersection, with the knees of a statue of someone once important to the Russians still standing on a pedestal. If the enemy sniper was in that tightly circumscribed universe, Gunther would make the kill. If he was a floor lower or higher, or a window to the left or right, they&#x2019;d never encounter each other. Tricky business. Wait, wait, wait.<br> <br>And finally the ordeal seemed to be paying off. He was convinced that within the darkness of the rear of the apartment whose interior was defined by his sight picture lay a patch more intense and more shaped than had been there in previous hours. He convinced himself he saw movement. He just wasn&#x2019;t quite sure, and if he fired and hit nothing, he would give this position up, and he&#x2019;d have to start anew tomorrow.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t want to stare too hard through the glass. Eyestrain and fatigue led to hallucinatory visions, and if he let himself, he&#x2019;d see Joe Stalin sitting in there, eating a plate of sardines and wiping his filthy peasant hands on his tunic. Realizing this as a trap, he closed his eyes every few seconds for some rest, so that he cut down on the pressure. But each time he opened them, he was certain there was a new shape in the shadow. It could have been a samovar on the floor, or the frame of a chair that lost a fight with a mortar round, or even the body of the occupant, but it also could have been a man in prone, hunched similarly over a weapon, eye pressed similarly to the scope. It didn&#x2019;t help that discriminations were made more difficult by reason of an occasional sunbeam that would break through the clouds and throw a shaft of illumination into the room just above the suspected enemy. When this happened, it broke Gunther&#x2019;s concentration and ruined his vision, and he had to blink and look away and wait until the condition passed.<br> <br>But Gunther felt safe. The Ivan snipers used a 3.5-power optic called a PU, which meant that even if his enemy were on him, the details would be so blurry that no sight picture could be made, not at 250 meters, which was about as far as the Mosin-Nagant with that scope was good for. So he felt invisible, even a little godlike. His higher degree of magnification gave him enough advantage.<br> <br>He would wait a little while longer. That low sun would disappear and full dark would come. Both opponents, if there was another opponent, would wait until that happened and then gradually disengage and come back to fight tomorrow. But Gunther had decided to shoot. He&#x2019;d been on this stand a week, and he convinced himself that he was seeing something new, having moved in at about three in the afternoon, and it could only be&#x2014;<br> <br>He closed his eyes. He counted to sixty.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not much time left, Gunther,&#x201d; came the call from his Landser, leaning out of the stairwell behind him. &#x201c;Need more hot water?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shhh!&#x201d; said Gunther.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to shoot! Maybe we can get out of here early!&#x201d;<br> <br>Then the soldier disappeared, knowing further distraction was to nobody&#x2019;s advantage. Gunther, meanwhile, prepared to fire. He carefully assembled his position behind the rifle, working methodically from toes to head, locking joints, finding angles for his limbs, making nuanced adjustments, building bone trusses under the seven-pound 7.92mm rifle resting on a sandbag, pushing the safety off, sliding his trigger finger out of the sheathing of the two gloves via a slot he&#x2019;d cut in each. He felt the trigger&#x2019;s coldness, felt his fingertip engage it, felt it move back, stacking slightly as it went, until it finally reached the precise edge between firing and not firing. At this point he committed fully by opening his eyes to acquire the picture through the glass of the Hensoldt Dialytan, four times larger than life, and settled the intersection of the crosswires on its center. He exhaled half his breath, put his weight against the trigger, feeling it just about to break, and then saw the flash.<br> <br>The round hit him on a slightly downward angle at the midpoint of his right shoulder, breaking a whole network of bones, though missing any major arteries or blood-bearing organs. It was not fatal. In fact, it saved his life; his shoulder was so ruinously damaged that he was evacuated from Stalingrad that night, one of the last to escape the Cauldron, as it came to be called, full of Paulus&#x2019;s unhappy men. Gunther lived to be eighty-nine years old, dying prosperous and well attended by grandchildren on his farm in Bavaria.<br> <br>However, at the point of impact it felt like someone had unloaded a full-swing ten-kilo sledgeweight against him, lifting him, twisting him, depositing him. He was aware that he had fired in reaction to the trauma but knew full well that the shot, jerked and spastic, had no chance of reaching the target.<br> <br>Dazzled by the shock, he recovered quickly and tried to cock the rifle but found of course that the arm attached to the now-destroyed shoulder no longer worked. Still, on instinct, his face returned to the stock, his eye returned to the scope, and it so happened that his opponent, having delivered the shot, had risen to depart just as one of those errant sunbeams pierced the interior of the room.

With its endearing, courageous heroine, cheerful humor, and wonderful, whimsical drawings of Paris, the Madeline stories are true classics that continue to charm readers, even after 75 years.&nbsp;Join Madeline in another adventure when she and Pepito run off to join the carnival with a band of traveling gypsies!&nbsp;<br><br>Ludwig Bemelmans (1898-1962) was the author of the beloved Madeline books, including&nbsp;<i>Madeline</i>, a Caldecott Honor Book, and&nbsp;<i>Madeline's Rescue</i>, winner of the Caldecott Medal.</p><p>One day Pepito, son of the Spanish ambassador who lives next door to Madeline, invites her and her cohorts to a Gypsy carnival. They venture forth excitedly, but suddenly a storm hits the fairgrounds, so everyone hops in a taxi and heads back home. Except for Madeline and Pepito, that is--forgotten and stuck at the top of a Ferris wheel in a downpour. Pepito climbs down to get help, and the Gypsy Mama takes the children under her wing ... and on the road. Gypsy life affords many previously forbidden wonders to the two kids--they get to float in a pool while everyone else is in school, and they don't have to brush their teeth, or even sleep. In between learning how to walk the tightrope and juggling, they send Miss Clavel a postcard. "'Thank heaven,' she said, 'The children are well! / But dear, oh dear, they've forgotten how to spell.'" As she and Madeline's 11 classmates race to find them (based on the postmark location), the Gypsy Mama sees the approaching Parisian posse in her crystal ball. Despite the Gypsy Mama's worst intentions, and the fact that she sewed the children into an old lion's costume to hide them, Madeline and Pepito are reunited with Miss Clavel and the others. The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> writes, "How inevitable that the irrepressible Madeline should one day meet up with gypsies.... As absurd and amusing as ever." (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Karin Snelson</i>Madeline And The Gypsies is the story of Madeline and a gypsy named Miss Clavel, who forgets about Madeline and Pepito in the ferris-wheel.</p><h2>Falconry and Hawking: The Essential Handbook - Including Equipment, Training and Health</h2><p><p><b>Falconry &amp; Hawking (recommended)</b></p><p><strong>The Essential Handbook - Including Equipment, Training, Health and More&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Discover everything you need to know about Falconry and Hawking from Philip Golding, a true master.

Her preferred method is rear-ending her targets and asking them for a ride. Her latest mark is Martin Trebeaux, owner of a private beach renourishment company who has delivered substandard sand to a mob hotel. But there's just one problem: Razor Girl hits the wrong guy. Instead, she ends up with Lane Coolman, talent manager for Buck Nance, the star of a reality TV show about a family of Cajun rooster farmers. Buck Nance, left to perform standup at a Key West bar without his handler, makes enough off-color jokes to incite a brawl, then flees for his life and vanishes.&nbsp;<br><br>Now a routine promotional appearance has become a missing persons case. And Andrew Yancy, disgraced detective-turned-health inspector, is on the job. That the Razor Girl may be the key to Yancy's future will be as surprising to him as anything else he encounters along the way&#x2014;including the giant Gambian pouched rats that are haunting his restaurant inspections.</p><p><b>CARL HIAASEN </b>was born and raised in Florida.

He nearly made it.<br><br>Twenty-seven miles from Coolman&#x2019;s destination, an old green Firebird bashed his car from behind. The impact failed to trigger the Buick&#x2019;s airbags, but Coolman heard the rear bumper dragging. He steered off the highway and dialed 911. In the mirror he saw the Firebird, its grille crimped and steaming, pull onto the shoulder. Ahead stood a sign that read: &#x201c;Ramrod Key.&#x201d;<br><br>Coolman went to check on the other driver, a woman in her mid-thirties with red hair.<br><br>&#x201c;Super-duper sorry,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;What the hell happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just a nick. Barely bleeding.&#x201d; She held her phone in one hand and a disposable razor in the other.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you out of your mind?&#x201d; said Coolman.<br><br>The driver&#x2019;s jeans and panties were bunched around her knees. She&#x2019;d been shaving herself when she smashed Coolman&#x2019;s rental car.<br><br>&#x201c;I got a date,&#x201d; she explained.<br><br>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t take care of that at home?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way! My husband would get so pissed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Unreal,&#x201d; said Coolman.<br><br>The woman was wearing a maroon fleece jacket and rhinestone flip-flops. On her pale thigh was the razor mark.<br><br>&#x201c;How about a little privacy?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not quite done here.&#x201d;<br><br>Coolman walked back to the Buick and called the man he was supposed to meet in Key West. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be a few minutes late. You&#x2019;re not gonna believe what just happened,&#x201d; he said on the man&#x2019;s voicemail, leaving it at that.<br><br>The cops arrived and wrote up the red-haired pube shaver for careless driving. Naturally, she had no collision insurance; that would be Avis&#x2019;s problem, not Lane Coolman&#x2019;s. A tow truck hauled away the Firebird, which needed a new front end including a radiator. The woman approached Coolman and asked for a ride.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell your &#x2018;date&#x2019; to come get you,&#x201d; he said. One of the police officers had pried the damaged bumper from the Buick, and Coolman was trying to fit it into the backseat.<br><br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t have a car,&#x201d; said the woman, who&#x2019;d buttoned her jeans. She was attractive in a loose and scattered way. Coolman had a weakness for redheads.<br><br>&#x201c;See, I work for an escort service. We go to where the client&#x2019;s at,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I understand the concept.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s fleece was unzipped and beneath it she wore a black sequined top. Her toes must be freezing in those flip-flops, Coolman thought; the temperature was 55 degrees with a biting north wind, arctic conditions for the Florida Keys.<br><br>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Merry,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;spelled like Merry Christmas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Bob,&#x201d; said Coolman, &#x201c;spelled like Bob.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does that mean you&#x2019;ll give me a lift?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not,&#x201d; Coolman said, the worst mistake he would ever make.<br><br>At Mile Marker 22, Merry told him her last name was Mansfield, like the bombshell actress of the Fifties. Coolman stopped at a Circle K where he got a cup of coffee and Merry bought three eight-hour energy drinks, chugging the little purple bottles one after the other.<br><br>&#x201c;You running a marathon?&#x201d; Coolman asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m all about performance.&#x201d;<br><br>At Mile Marker 17, she told him she didn&#x2019;t really work for an escort service.<br><br>&#x201c;Wild guess&#x2014;you&#x2019;re a dancer,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;On my own time,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;Not one of those.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean it in a bad way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you just say stripper? The games you guys play, I swear.&#x201d; Her eyelashes were a paler shade of red than her hair.<br><br>Coolman said, &#x201c;Why would you make up a lie about being an escort?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Cause I needed a ride, Bob. If I said I was an artifacts appraiser you would&#x2019;ve left me standing in the road.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it you appraise?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sunken treasure. Doubloons and cannonballs and so forth. Business is slow right now. I&#x2019;m an expert on eighteenth-century Spanish maritime.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have a real date, or did you make up that part, too?&#x201d;<br><br>Merry laughed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s an Air Force pilot based at Boca Chica. Why else would I be doin&#x2019; my trim at sixty-five miles per hour?&#x201d;<br><br>At Mile Marker 8, she blurted, &#x201c;Did I say Air Force? I meant Navy.&#x201d; She was buzzing like a flagpole in a lightning storm. &#x201c;His name&#x2019;s Rocky.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about your husband?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a Rocky, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; said Coolman.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be judging me. I go for men with strong names.&#x201d;<br><br>The closer they got to Key West, the more Southern her accent became. Coolman was foolishly intrigued.<br><br>&#x201c;What about you?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your field, Bob? Your expertise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the entertainment business. I manage talent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your own, or somebody else&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ever seen the show Bayou Brethren?&#x201d; Coolman asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Little Rocky watches it all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s your son? Little Rocky?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s what I call my husband. Don&#x2019;t make me spell out why.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anyway, I manage Buck. You know&#x2014;the family patriarch? Buck Nance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No shit?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Leader of the clan,&#x201d; said Coolman.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, Bob, I know what a fucking patriarch is.&#x201d;<br><br>The show was taped in the Florida Panhandle at a swampy location that somewhat resembled a Louisiana bayou. Buck Nance and his brothers were actually from Wisconsin, but the network paid for a Cajun dialogue coach.<br><br>Merry said, &#x201c;So what brings you all the way down here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buck has a personal appearance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Parched Pirate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doing what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just being Buck.&#x201d;<br><br>Coolman hoped the guitar player had found the bar. Buck Nance had trouble speaking in public unless he was accompanied by a live musician. For his road gigs the writers at the network had come up with eight or nine amusing redneck stories, what you might call a monologue, and afterward Buck would take questions for ten minutes or so. The questions were printed on index cards distributed in advance to random fuckwits in the crowd.<br><br>Coolman offered to take Merry to the show. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll hang backstage,&#x201d; he added. Like there was a backstage.<br><br>&#x201c;What about my date?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Bail,&#x201d; Coolman said. &#x201c;Tell him the truth&#x2014;you had car trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But then I shaved down there for no reason.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not necessarily.&#x201d;<br><br>The redhead smiled and shook her head. &#x201c;For the Zac Brown Band I&#x2019;d ditch my Navy boy in a heartbeat, but not for some yahoo from the bayou.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only the top-rated cable program in the whole country.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I prefer the nature channels. You know&#x2014;penguins and cheetahs. Shit like that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buck converted his Bentley to an ATV with rifle racks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why would a grown man do something so ridiculous?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;America worships the guy. You should come hear him tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Another time,&#x201d; said Merry.<br><br>At Mile Marker 5, she made a call on her cell phone. All she said was, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t wet yourself, sugar. I&#x2019;m almost there.&#x201d;<br><br>At Mile Marker 4, after they&#x2019;d crossed the bridge into Key West, she flipped open the visor mirror and checked her makeup. Freshened her lipstick. Brushed her hair.<br><br>&#x201c;You look terrific,&#x201d; said Coolman.<br><br>&#x201c;Damn right, Bob.&#x201d;<br><br>At Mile Marker 3, she exclaimed, &#x201c;Okay, pull in here!&#x201d;<br><br>It was a small shopping center with a Sears as the high point. Merry directed Coolman where to park. He was surprised when a white Tesla rolled up beside them.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s your boyfriend?&#x201d; Coolman knew a couple of CAA agents back in L.A. who drove jet-black Teslas. The white model looked pretty sweet. Coolman himself leased a corpuscle-red Mercedes SLK 350 that required no electric outlet.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you said he didn&#x2019;t have wheels.&#x201d;<br><br>Merry shrugged. &#x201c;Must be a loaner.&#x201d;<br><br>The young man who got out of the Tesla was wearing a leather bomber jacket. If not for the gold earring and oily long hair he could have been a Navy pilot.<br><br>&#x201c;It was nice meeting you,&#x201d; Coolman said to the redhead.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re coming with.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me? What for?&#x201d;<br><br>The man in the bomber jacket yanked open Coolman&#x2019;s door and put a pistol to his neck.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, dipshit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just take my wallet,&#x201d; Coolman said, breathless. &#x201c;The Rolex, too, whatever you want.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re adorable, Bob,&#x201d; the woman whispered. &#x201c;Now get out of the fucking car.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Timber Press Guide to Succulent Plants of the World: A Comprehensive Reference to More than 2000 Species</h2><p><p>The plants are organized into 28 intuitively logical groups, such as succulent euphorbias, mesembryanthemums, bulbs, succulent trees, aloes, agaves, and haworthias.

Most doctors recommend surgery as the only answer. Now this innovative holistic program brings new hope for a surgery-free life to millions of American women.<br> <br>Dr. Allan Warshowsky combines traditional Western medicine and holistic science to cure not just the fibroid condition but also the underlying imbalances and systemic dysfunctions that can cause fibroids. With an exciting program of diet, exercise, supplements, herbs, and mind/spirit work, Dr. Warshowsky shows fibroid sufferers how to become the strong, healthy women they deserve to be.</p><p><b>Allan Warshowsky, M.D.,</b> has been a practicing, board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist for more than twenty years and is currently the director of The Women's Program at New York's Beth Israel Hospital's Center for Health and Healing. He is a popular speaker on the subjects of women's health and holistic healing.Also called myomas, fibromyomas, or leiomyomas, fibroids develop from a single smooth muscle cell in the uterus and vary in size and shape. They affect as many as 80 percent of women, of whom one in four will have symptoms serious enough to cause her to seek medical advice and treatment. These two practical, easy-to-read guides offer information on the different types of fibroids and the options for treating them. In Healing Fibroids, Warshowsky, a practicing obstetrician/ gynecologist and director of the Women's Program at Beth Israel Hospital's Center for Health and Healing in New York, and Oumano, a certified yoga teacher and bodywork practitioner, combine Western medicine and holistic methods to point the way to optimal health and the avoidance of surgery. After a brief look at surgical procedures and the relationship of hormones and the menstrual cycle to fibroids, they devote chapters to diet, supplements, herbal remedies, exercise, emotional healing, and the effects of environmental toxins, especially xenoestrogens. Skilling, a marketing executive and writer in New York, wrote her first book, Fibroids: The Complete Guide to Taking Charge of Your Physical, Emotional and Sexual Well-Being, when she was first diagnosed with fibroids and could find little information on the subject. She also explores the role of diet, exercise, and emotional well-being in managing fibroids. Arranged by day for the first week after diagnosis, by week for the first month, and by month for the remaining 11 months, the chapters are each divided into two sections, called "Living" and "Learning." The "Living" sections deal with issues and problems, while the "Learning" sections explain the more technical aspects of fibroids. Skilling provides practical tips, such as how to chart the growth of the fibroid and what to wear when you leave the hospital should you need surgery. Readers will find information on current research and medication, the pros and cons of various types of surgery, and hints on diet and lifestyle changes, including exercise and stress management. While both guides are useful, Skilling's arrangement is superior. Her table of contents provides good access points, and the glossary, selected resources, and list of bibliographic references are a definite plus. If you have the budget, get both; but if you have to choose, buy Skilling's. Jodith Janes, Cleveland Clinic Fdn.

Today, Moore is one of the most widely admired chefs to come out of the region. In this cookbook, he tells the story of how he started his wildly popular Saltbox Seafood Joint� restaurants and food truck in Durham, North Carolina. Moore, a formally trained chef, was led by a culinary epiphany in the famous wet markets of Singapore to start a restaurant focused purely on the food inspired by the Carolina coast and its traditional roadside fish shacks and camps. Saltbox Seafood Joint's success is a testament to Moore's devotion to selecting the freshest seasonal ingredients every day and preparing them perfectly.<br><br>In sixty recipes that celebrate his coastal culinary heritage, Moore instructs cooks how to prepare Saltbox Seafood Joint dishes. This cookbook, written with K. C. Hysmith, explains how to pan-fry and deep-fry, grill and smoke, and cook up soups, chowders, stews, and grits and seafood. Moore has taken pity on us and even included the recipe for his famous Hush-Honeys�, an especially addictive hushpuppy.

Barnum's career of showmanship and charlatanry was marked by a surprising undercurrent of honesty and forthrightness. His exuberant autobiography forms a happy combination of all those traits, revealing the whole story of his world-famous hoaxes and publicity stunts. Here is a pageant of nineteenth-century America's gullibility and thirst for marvels, as told by the master of revels himself.<br>A born storyteller, Barnum recalls his association with Tom Thumb, his audience with Queen Victoria, and his trouble keeping Jenny Lind's angelic image intact during a trying tour. He tells of Jumbo, the most famous elephant in history, from the creature's heroic arrival in America to its tragic death in a railroad accident; of his attempts to transfer Shakespeare's house and Madame Tussaud's Waxworks from England to New York; and of his triumphant reentry into public life after financial failure and five disastrous fires had all but wiped him out. The true-life tale of a man of boundless imagination and indomitable energy, Barnum's autobiography embodies the spirit of America's most exciting boom years.</p><p>Phineas Taylor "P. T." Barnum (1810&#x2013;1891) formed the circus that came to be known as The Greatest Show on Earth. A brash, larger-than-life&nbsp;entrepreneur, he transformed the nature of commercial entertainment in the 19th century, from his private museum of curiosities to his big-top extravaganzas. Barnum introduced audiences to General Tom Thumb, Jumbo the elephant,&nbsp;and Jenny Lind, "The Swedish nightingale," among other sensations. He concluded his career&nbsp;by serving two terms in the legislature of his home state, Connecticut, and as the mayor of Bridgeport.</p><h2>Dwell: Life with God for the World</h2><p>Popular notions of Christian spirituality today tend to focus on getting us out of the world or getting the world out of us. Many are looking to spirituality as a means of disengaging from this life&#x2015;to experience the transcendent or discover personal wholeness. On the other hand, much of popular Christian thought seems to be about avoiding the corruption of the world by being pious and following the rules. But Jesus offers a radical model for living. As the Incarnate One who dwelt among us to accomplish the mission of God, he teaches us how to dwell <em>in</em> the world for the sake <em>of</em> the world. If we are to become like him, we must learn what it means to live out this missional spirituality in the places we dwell. What does a Christian life deeply rooted in the logic of the Incarnation look like? Missional teacher and pastor Barry Jones shares his vision for authentic Christian spirituality focused on becoming more like Jesus. We dwell in a specific place and time in history, with unique bodies and in a world for which God has great purposes of redemption. This presence in the world should lead us to pattern our lives after the life of Jesus who was a boundary breaker, a shalom-maker, a people-keeper, and a wounded-healer. "Jesus' life shows us what it looks like to be fully human, to be whole and holy . . . to be in the world and not of the world, to live passionately for the world and not protectively withdrawn from it, " says Jones. "Allowing the logic of the Incarnation to inform our vision of the spiritual life corrects the tendency toward a self-oriented pursuit of transcendence or a negative spirituality of behavior modification and disengagement from the world." Including practical suggestions for real-life application and questions for discussion, Jones describes living a missional life from a place of deep connection with and dependence on God. Not only must we have a clear and compelling vision of the life we want to live, but we must also cultivate the spiritual disciplines necessary to live out our vision in the specific contexts of day-to-day life. We need a renewed vision of Christian spirituality that leads us to be conformed into the image of Christ who dwelt <em>with</em> us <em>for</em> us.</p><p>Barry D. Jones teaches spiritual formation and pastoral theology at Dallas Theological Seminary and holds a PhD in theology from Wheaton College. He serves as teaching pastor at Irving Bible Church.<br><br>Michael Frost is an internationally recognized Australian missiologist and one of the leading voices in the missional church movement. He is the vice principal of Morling College in Sydney, Australia, and the founding director of the Tinsley Institute, a mission study centre located at Morling College. A popular speaker around the world, he has written more than a dozen books including <em>The Shaping of Things to Come</em>, <em>Exiles</em>, <em>The Road to Missional</em>, and <em>Incarnate</em>. An expert in church planting, Frost cofounded the Forge Mission Training Network with Alan Hirsch. He remains an international director of that movement which is now based in the United States."This book is highly recommended. The presentation is accessible to a wide audience; yet scholars will find it helpful. It is written at a level that educated laypeople will find encouraging and challenging; yet pastors and Christian leaders will find it stimulating. It is practical in its application and well illustrated. It is biblically grounded, theologically informed, and culturally focused. It would make an excellent choice for a small group discussion as well as an introductory textbook for spiritual formation courses. It should be on the reading list of everyone interested in following Jesus into the world with the good news of hope and redemption." (Glenn R. Kreider, Bibliotheca Sacra, January&#x2013;March 2015)<br><br>"In this exploration of missional spirituality, Barry Jones offers an assessment of our broken world and the common errors and bent practices that subvert a rich engagement. Then he shows us the horizon: a vision of the coming shalom of God's kingdom. But more than a mere vision, he shows us the path to pursue in living with God for the world, a grammar for the disciplines in five words: <em>attentiveness, receptivity, embodiment, community,</em> and <em>rhythm</em>. In a lovely integration of head and heart, he closes with a chapter on 'placemaking.' The covenantal triangle has not changed: God, people and place&#x2015;that's the way to shalom and God's new world!" (Len Hjalmarson, author of Missional Spirituality and No Home Like Place)<br><br>"To hear Barry tell it, living with-God-for-the-world is the key to all human flourishing. . . . In this nexus lies the hope of real, abundant, rich, beautiful human existence. It?s the place that Jesus modeled for us and about which he spoke when he urged us to love God with all our hearts and souls and minds, and to love our neighbors as ourselves. . . . <em>Dwell</em> makes a profound and timely contribution to both missional and pastoral studies." (Michael Frost, author, Incarnate, from the foreword)<br><br>"<em>Dwell</em> is an excellent book on a very important topic that we are only just beginning to grapple with&#x2015;the meaning of incarnational ministry in the church that follows the incarnated One. Oh, and it is well-written to boot. Enjoy!" (Alan Hirsch, founding director of Forge and Future Travelers)<br><br>"This fused missional spirituality/spiritual missionality is creation-affirming, people-affirming, body-affirming; it is intimately connected to God's presence and just reign and majors in sharing God's dream of shalom, allowing that dream to pervade our lives."

A longtime commercial livestock farmer who takes a natural approach to husbandry, Coleby covers breeds of sheep, wool, meat and milk production, feeding requirements, poisonous plants, minerals and vitamins, herbal, homeopathic and natural remedies, and more. Originally published in Australia, this edition has been expanded significantly in the areas of breeding for finer wool and meat, land management, sheep management, and treatment of health problems. Coleby&#39;s step-by-step explanations of how to best benefit from a naturalistic, holistic approach make this book an invaluable resource for everyone with sheep.</p><p>Pat Coleby has been instituting eco-farming techniques in Australia for the last half-century. She practices commercial-scale farming and writes and travels extensively as a lecturer and farm consultant. Early on in her career, she realized that conventional veterinary medicine was far from a cure-all. She recognized that good nutrition is the key to preventing ill health in animals, and her prescriptions of non-invasive, natural remedies resulted in amazing, seemingly miraculous cures in animals whose cases conventional veterinary wisdom would abandon. As word of the success of her natural treatment spread, Coleby quickly became known as an expert on holistic animal care. Coleby has written numerous books on holistic livestock husbandry and land stewardship including <i>Natural Cattle Care, Natural Goat Care </i>and <i>Natural Horse Care</i>, also available from Acres U.S.A.</p><h2>Capitalism: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>What is capitalism?

This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> addresses questions such as, "what is capital?" before discussing the history and development of capitalism through several detailed case studies, ranging from the <em>tulipomania</em> of 17th century Holland, the Great Depression of the 1930s, and in this new edition, the impact of the global financial crisis that started in 2007-08.<br><br>James Fulcher looks at the different forms that capitalism takes in Britain, Japan, Sweden, and the United States, and explores whether capitalism has escaped the nation-state by going global.

There were no cemeteries on the continent of Thaisia, no individual gravestones, no family mausoleums unless you were very rich. Cities couldn&#x2019;t afford to waste land on the dead when the living needed every acre that they were grudgingly permitted to lease from the terra indigene who ruled the continent.<br><br>Who ruled the world. They had smashed and torn that harsh truth into humans around the world, and only fools or the blindly optimistic thought there was any chance of things going back to the way they had been before the Humans First and Last movement had started the war against the terra indigene here in Thaisia and in Cel-�Romano on the other side of the Atlantik Ocean.<br><br>Instead of gaining anything from the war, humans had lost ground&#x2014;�literally. Cities had been destroyed or were no longer under human control. People were running to anyplace they thought could provide safety, thinking that the larger cities were less vulnerable to what the Others could do.<br><br>In that, too, humans were wrong. The destruction of so much of �Toland, a large human-�controlled city on the East Coast, should have taught people that much.<br><br>But this wasn&#x2019;t a day to think about those things.<br><br>Jana found the large flower bed with the tall granite marker in the center.<br><br>There were no graveyards, no gravestones, in Thaisia, but there were memorial parks full of flower beds and small ponds, with benches positioned so the living could visit with the dead. She looked down the double column of names carved into the granite until she found the two she&#x2019;d come to see. Martha Chase. Wilbur Chase. The foster parents who had taken her from the foundling home and raised her as their own. There hadn&#x2019;t been even a birth certificate left with her when the Universal Temple priests had found her on the temple doorstep. Just a printed note with her name and birth date.<br><br>All bodies were cremated and the ashes mixed with the soil in these flower beds, the names carved in the granite the only acknowledgment of who was there. Martha had loved growing flowers, and Pops had always tended a small vegetable garden in their backyard. Jana was the one who had no skill with the soil, no matter how hard she tried. She knew a rose from a daisy, understood the difference between annual and perennial, and, most of the time, had dug up weeds instead of flowers when she tried to help Martha tidy the beds.<br><br>You have other talents, Pops used to say with a laugh.<br><br>Other talents.

There wasn&#x2019;t much. Martha and Pops had never been interested in things, but the sale of the house and furnishings was enough to pay off the school loans she&#x2019;d taken out to attend a community college while she tried to get accepted into the police academy. It was enough to pay for the academy and living expenses. She&#x2019;d been frugal, but if she didn&#x2019;t get a job soon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Martha,&#x201d; Jana said softly after looking around to make sure she was alone. &#x201c;Hey, Pops.&#x201d; She sat on the bench, her hands folded in her lap. &#x201c;I graduated from the academy. The only woman who stuck it out. �Martha, you always said I was stubborn, and I guess you were right. I have a meeting with the academy administrator next week. Hopefully it will be about a job offer. The gods know, every human community needs cops right now, and everyone else in my class has already been hired by towns in the Northeast Region, which lost officers last month because of the war. But I know there are positions that haven&#x2019;t been filled yet because no one wants to take a job in a village stuck in the middle of the wild country. They say that&#x2019;s just delayed suicide. Maybe they&#x2019;re right, but I&#x2019;d take that chance.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked at the flowers growing in the bed and wished she could remember the names of some of them. &#x201c;I came to say good-�bye. It&#x2019;s getting harder and harder to purchase a bus ticket, and I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;ll be able to get back here again. And if I&#x2019;m hired&#x2014;�when I&#x2019;m hired&#x2014;�I may be leaving in a hurry.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Thanks for everything. When I get to wherever I&#x2019;m going, I&#x2019;ll light a candle in remembrance.&#x201d;<br><br>Jana hurried through the park, gauging that she had just enough time to reach the bus stop near the park gates and catch the bus back to Hubb NE. She hoped that by this time next week she&#x2019;d be heading to another town to do the only job she&#x2019;d ever wanted to do.</p><h2>What I&#39;d Say to the Martians: And Other Veiled Threats</h2><p>Jack Handey is one of America's favorite humorists, from his <em>New Yorker</em> pieces to his <em>Deep Thoughts</em> books and <em>Saturday Night Live</em> sketches.

Visit her at MarlaFrazee.com.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014; In this warmhearted appeal to our better angels, Clinton reminds us how change comes about. Also that community, a sense of purpose, and kindness toward others begins at home. In spare lyrical text that plays with the proverb "It takes a village to raise a child," and is enhanced by Frazee's lovely pencil-and-watercolor vignettes, the book shows how children and their grown-ups come together to build a playground. The scene opens with a barren hillside and a bare tree; then, the intergenerational villagers come together, roll up their sleeves, and contribute to the project, each in his or her own way. Viewers are told that "Kindness and caring and sharing matter. Playing matters too. And resting. Because the world is in a hurry, but children are not." As the structures grow and their labors bear fruit, the passage of time is reflected in the greening landscape, the colorful plantings, and the pink blossoms of the large majestic tree as the park's centerpiece. In conclusion, Clinton expands the metaphor to state "Children are born believers. And citizens, too. Let us build a village...worthy of all children." The book's stunning endpapers feature American flags, with communities rising from each of the stripes and a rainbow on the horizon.

Rowling&#x2019;s <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x2019;s Stone</em>, author John Stephens weaves a gripping tale of mystery and magic into <em>The Emerald Atlas</em>. His enchanting prose and spot-on wit can only be described as both hip (Stephens was previously the executive producer of <em>Gossip Girls</em>) and Dickensian, a delightful combination that will both engage young readers with its relatable nature and fascinate them with its aberrant charm. If Stephens's comic finesse and archetypal writing style aren&#x2019;t enough to engage young readers, they will no doubt be captivated by the plot. Stephens's complex formula for time travel and fascinating explanation for the disappearance of the magical realm is so convincing that readers might begin to believe that there is, in fact, far more to the world than meets the eye. Thought-provoking and enchanting, <em>The Emerald Atlas</em> has the makings of a children&#x2019;s classic. --<em>Jacqueline Segall</em> <p><strong>Amazon-Exclusive Q&amp;A with Author John Stephens</strong> <br> <strong>Amazon:</strong> You started off in television, co-producing and writing for <em>The Gilmore Girls</em> and <em>The O.C.</em>, and then moved on to be the executive producer (and occasional writer and director) for <em>Gossip Girls</em>. After establishing yourself in Hollywood, what inspired you to change your course and write a children's book trilogy?</p> <p></p> <p><strong>John:</strong> Honestly, sometimes I ask myself that question in the reverse. How did I ever end up in Hollywood? The truth is that writing novels was my first ambition, and given my druthers when I finished grad school, I probably would&#x2019;ve gone off and just written books. The only problem was that at the time I was pretty bad at it. I really kinda stunk. As it turned out, I needed another decade of learning the craft before I was ready to write a novel. And, fortunately, writing for Hollywood turns out to be a great training ground. You learn how to work on a schedule, tell a satisfying story, build character, construct scenes, you develop a feel for dramatic momentum...and you get to tool around the Warner Bros lot on a golf cart, which is kind of awesome. In fact, writing and producing television was so much fun I kind of forgot about writing books for a while. That is, till the day I read <em>The Golden Compass</em> by Philip Pullman and realized that all I wanted to do was write children&#x2019;s fantasy novels. And luckily by then I had the skills to pull it off without embarrassing myself.</p> <p>Though I do still miss cruising around the lot on golf carts.</p> <p><strong>Amazon:</strong> The whole time I was reading <em>The Emerald Atlas</em>, I kept thinking what a great movie it would make. Are there any plans for a film version?</p> <p><strong>John:</strong> I hope so! Wouldn&#x2019;t that be awesome? Unfortunately, at present, if people are making plans, they haven&#x2019;t told me about them.</p> <p><strong>Amazon:</strong> I loved the characters of Kate, Emma, and Michael. They were all so relatable. I felt as if they were kids I had met before. Were your three young heroes inspired by anyone in your life or from your childhood?</p> <p><strong>John:</strong> Kate not so much (though she does share a name with my younger sister). Her closest inspiration came from a character in the movie <em>Not One Less</em> by Zyang Yimou, where this young girl is put in charge of a schoolhouse in rural China, and the teacher tells her that she&#x2019;ll be paid if all the children are there when he returns. Well, of course one of the kids, this little rapscallion, runs away, and she has to track him down to this big city. And the job of finding this kid in this huge city is OVERWHELMING and yet this girl is unbelievably tenacious. I just loved that sense of incredible strength in someone so young.</p> <p>Emma is partly inspired from a friend of mine, a writer I worked with who can be incredibly combative and feisty, but also has an enormous heart. I love that combination of fury and vulnerability.</p> <p>Michael, in many ways, was based on me. We&#x2019;re both the middle brother of two sisters, studious, wear glasses, think dwarves are awesome, and have a need to document our worlds. However, like all characters, he grew away from me and became much braver and more resourceful than I could ever hope to be.</p> <p><strong>Amazon:</strong> The fantasy world in <em>The Emerald Atlas</em> is described in such detail that it really comes to life in the mind of the reader. What was your inspiration for the world that Kate, Emma, and Michael happen upon?</p> <p><strong>John:</strong> The inspiration was the Adirondacks of upstate New York. A few years ago, I spent a lot of time up near Lake Placid and I found the area to be really magical and just imbued with history, in particular, a romantic, turn-of-the-century, Edith Wharton-type of history that I found very appealing. British fantasy writers are surrounded by buildings, streets, and graveyards that are centuries old. Fantasy and magic seems to cling to those places. It&#x2019;s a little bit harder to find that in the States, but I felt the Adirondacks had that quality in spades, as well as being near the old stomping grounds of Washington Irving, who sort of began the tradition of American fantasy I was trying to nod towards.</p> <p><strong>Amazon:</strong> You have a distinctly individual voice and plotline in <em>The Emerald Atlas</em>, but your writing style does invoke thoughts of some children&#x2019;s fantasy classics. The beginning portion of <em>The Emerald Atlas</em> reminded me a little bit of Lemony Snicket&#x2019;s <em>A Series of Unfortunate Events</em>, while the main body of your work read more similarly to C.S. Lewis&#x2019;s The Chronicles of Narnia and Phillip Pullman&#x2019;s His Dark Materials trilogy, and the action scenes reminded me most of J.K Rowling&#x2019;s Harry Potter series. Which writers would you say inspired you most as an author?</p> <p><strong>John:</strong> First off, to say that my book reminds you of those writers is a HUGE compliment, so thank you. I feel very indebted to particular writers for very specific things. Among the ones you mention...from Pullman, I love the authority of his other worlds. He believes in Lyra&#x2019;s world completely and he makes you believe in it. Also, his characters live at the edges of their feelings, which makes reading the books enormously exciting. From Lewis, at his best, he can convey a true sense of magic to readers, especially young readers. And though I don&#x2019;t love all his books, his prose is always great. I admire so much about J.K. Rowling&#x2019;s books but just to pick a couple things, she has a Dickensian affection for side characters that I also have. Also, she shares with Roald Dahl, one of my other literary heroes, a taste for the comic grotesque. I&#x2019;m deeply indebted to Edith Nesbit, most particularly for her Bastable books. I love her humor, her lightness of touch and above all the interaction of her children. And finally, I&#x2019;d just say Dickens for so many things, but mostly because he proved again and again that a funny book can also be moving.</p><p>My first day as a paid writer in Hollywood, I was tooling around the Warner Bros lot in a golf cart and nearly ran down Martin Sheen, who was then starring as President Bartlett on <em>The West Wing</em>.&nbsp; Killing a president, even a fictional one, is a bad first-day-on-the-job move.&nbsp; Luckily, Martin Sheen is very nimble, and I was neither fired nor shot by fictional Secret Service.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I had arrived in Los Angeles from the University of Virginia where I had gotten an MFA in creative writing.&nbsp; Now, when you live in Virginia and you tell people you&#x2019;re moving to Hollywood to be a writer, the most common response is, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give up your apartment.&#x201d;&nbsp; The second most common response is, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re an idiot.&#x201d;&nbsp; This one is most often spoken by people related to you.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Flash-forward two years and that same idiot is nearly running down Martin Sheen in a golf cart.&nbsp; Yes, he&#x2019;s still an idiot, but now he&#x2019;s employed!&nbsp; Getting paid to write in Hollywood!&nbsp; My second week on the lot, I saw Arnold Schwarzenegger, as he was shooting a movie called <em>Collateral Damage</em>.&nbsp; My friend and I peeked into a sound stage and saw the soon-to-be-Governor destroying the craft service table.&nbsp; Ho-ho&#x2019;s, ding-dongs, Twizzlers, nothing stood a chance.&nbsp; It was a true Hollywood moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But being a television writer wasn&#x2019;t just about running down fictional Commander-in-Chiefs or seeing Arnold demolish the snack table; there was the job itself, which mostly involved sitting around a table with your friends, making each other laugh, and getting a free lunch.&nbsp; Or having real actors &#x2013; actors you&#x2019;ve seen on actual TV &#x2013; say lines you&#x2019;ve written!&nbsp; Or writing a line in a script like, &#x201c;So and So goes to the Harvest Festival, and there are twelve jugglers in lederhosen and a dog riding a bike,&#x201d; and then you show up on set and there in front of you are twelve jugglers wearing lederhosen and an animal wrangler trying to jam a schnauzer onto a tricycle.&nbsp; You put words on a page, and a small army of people make them happen.&nbsp; It was surreal and amazing and a lot of fun.&nbsp; At its best, writing for television was like putting on a play in high school with your friends.&nbsp; You get the costumes!&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll write the script!&nbsp; Mike will be the actor because he&#x2019;s the best-looking!&nbsp; And you got to do it week after week, get paid for it, and as long as Martin Sheen was safe in his trailer, you got to drive the golf cart.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So why would you ever leave that?&nbsp; Why did I?&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Because one day I read <em>The Golden Compass</em> by Philip Pullman, and I thought, &#x201c;Holy Crud, this guy&#x201d; and by &#x2018;this guy&#x2019; I mean P.P., that&#x2019;s what I call him, P.P., &#x201c;is doing what I want to be doing.&#x201d;&nbsp; Not only that, it was as if I&#x2019;d wanted to do it for years and years but just hadn&#x2019;t realized it because I&#x2019;d been too busy stalking Arnold S.&nbsp; And suddenly I knew that I was going to have to leave the lederhosen-wearing jugglers and the bicycle-riding dogs and the hanging out in the writers&#x2019; room and the running-down of Martin Sheen to someone else.&nbsp; I was going to write children&#x2019;s fantasy books.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And of course, when I told my friends in Virginia that I was quitting my television writing jobs to write children&#x2019;s books, they said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re an idiot.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said, smiling, &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>True Feelings: God&#39;s Gracious and Glorious Purpose for Our Emotions</h2><p>Emotions can be confusing. At times, we live at the mercy of our emotions, feeling helpless to understand them and powerless to control them.

In this book, a mother-daughter team offers women a fresh perspective on their feelings straight from God&#39;s Word, helping them handle emotions in a way that honors God and others. Pointing women to godly habits and unpacking the role of feelings in everyday life, this book offers hope for flourishing with the emotions that God gave them.</p><p><p><strong>Carolyn Mahaney</strong> is a wife, mother, and homemaker.

A prolific author, this is his 16th book in the field of sexuality, including best-selling <i>Rekindling Desire</i> and <i> Sexual Awareness</i>.Barry McCarthy has written a thorough, state-of-the-art, and, above all, a practical guide for any therapist who ever encounters a sexual problem in clients. It can be used as a reference by topic or gulped down in one piece. Sex Made Simple should be on the bookshelf of every working couples therapist. <br><b>Terry Real, LICSW</b> Author of <i>The New Rules of Marriage</i> &amp; <i>I Don t Want to Talk About It</i><br><br> Dr. McCarthy has, once again, demonstrated why he is considered a master sex therapist. In this book, he has taken what are often considered extremely complex sexual difficulties, and made them simple. Through the effective use of text, case studies and very user-friendly exercises, Dr. McCarthy has created an invaluable guide for clinicians and couples alike. <br><b>Daniel N. Watter, EdD</b> President, Society for Sex Therapy and Research<br><br> <i>Sex Made Simple</i> is valuable in that it is specifically written for the general psychotherapist, is brimming with practical information, and case illustrations. Dr. McCarthy shares his years of clinical experience in this text which should be part of every therapist's library. Both beginning and experienced therapists will find this book to be easy to read and informative. <br><b>Robert Taylor Segraves, MD</b> Editor, Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy<br><br> Once again Barry McCarthy offers us a thoughtful and profound book on sexuality, one that takes the angst out of sexuality and offers a clear straightforward path to sexual fulfillment. <br><b>Sue Johnson, EdD</b> Founder of the International Center for Excellence in Emotionally Focused Therapy and author of <i>Hold Me Tight: Seven Conversations for a Lifetime of Love</i> and <i>Love Sense: The Revolutionary New Science of Romantic Relationships</i><br><br> The time has come for therapists to become sex positive and up-to-date with the latest sex therapy information and Barry McCarthy is the therapist to provide it. With his pro-sexuality stance, he corrects the myths by citing current research and transforming it into good, solid clinical work. This book provides therapists with step-by-step treatment planning and goals for all clients and is inclusive of gender, sexual orientations and diverse sexual expressions. After finishing this book, therapists will be armed with the right tools and information they need to provide sex therapy. --<b>Joe Kort, PhD, LMSW</b> Author of <i>Gay Affirmative Therapy for the Straight Clinician</i><br><br>An excellent resource! As therapists we often focus on helping couples improve sexual functioning, yet Barry McCarthy explains that the real struggle is inhibited sexual desire. Focusing on desire as the core component of healthy sexuality, McCarthy delivers brilliant guidelines and exercises to help couples integrate intimacy and eroticism into their sexual style. --<b>Kathleen Mates-Youngman, M.A. LMFT</b> author of <i>Couples Therapy Workbook: 30 Guided Conversations To Re-Connect Relationships</i><br><br>In the world of sex therapists, a few are writers. Of those fewer still are succinct and wise. Barry McCarthy's recent book is very much in keeping with his other works. He gives up-to-date, practical, and scientifically informed advice. <i>Sex Made Simple</i> is indeed an honest, direct, clearly stated book about couples and their sexual health. The effortlessness of the writing - so easy to understand - belies what all sex therapists know about Barry McCarthy. He is at the top of the field and has written a series of books that have helped thousands of couples (and hundreds of sex therapists helping thousands of couples). This book is at the top of my recommendation list. Bravo Barry McCarthy for writing such an accessible and wonderful book. --<b>Sallie Foley, LMSWM</b>, ASSECT certified sexuality educator, supervisor and diplomate of sex therapy<br><br> Illustrated with thoughtful case studies <i>Sex Made Simple</i> offers deceptively sophisticated guidance for the experienced or novice individual and couple therapists alike. McCarthy teaches clinicians the needed concepts and interventions to expand their therapeutic repertoire, enabling them to facilitate improvement in their client s sex lives. Highly readable and informative, it is already an excellent addition to our library. --<b>Michael A. Perelman, Ph.D.</b>, NY Weill Cornell Medical Center<br><br> <i>Sex Made Simple</i> is an excellent addition to the clinical literature on sexual disorders and one that will be welcomed by clinicians who have hesitated to delve into these complicated problems when working with couples. McCarthy's advice is empowering; rather than functioning as sex gurus or keepers of mysterious sexual knowledge, therapists are charged with helping clients articulate their sexual voices and bringing them into dialogue with their partners. --<b>Andrea Bradford, PhD</b>, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas</p><h2>The Language Hoax</h2><p>Japanese has a term that covers both green and blue. Russian has separate terms for dark and light blue. Does this mean that Russians perceive these colors differently from Japanese people? Does language control and limit the way we think? <br><br>This short, opinionated book addresses the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which argues that the language we speak shapes the way we perceive the world. Linguist John McWhorter argues that while this idea is mesmerizing, it is plainly wrong. It is language that reflects culture and worldview, not the other way around. The fact that a language has only one word for eat, drink, and smoke doesn't mean its speakers don't process the difference between food and beverage, and those who use the same word for blue and green perceive those two colors just as vividly as others do. <br><br>McWhorter shows not only how the idea of language as a lens fails but also why we want so badly to believe it: we're eager to celebrate diversity by acknowledging the intelligence of peoples who may not think like we do. Though well-intentioned, our belief in this idea poses an obstacle to a better understanding of human nature and even trivializes the people we seek to celebrate. The reality -- that all humans think alike -- provides another, better way for us to acknowledge the intelligence of all peoples.<br></p><p><br><strong>John McWhorter </strong>is Professor of Linguistics at Columbia University and author of many books, including <em>The Power of Babel: A Natural History of Language</em>, <em>Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue: The Untold Story of English</em>, and <em>What Language Is, What It Isn't, and What It Could Be</em>.

His work has appeared in <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Time</em>, and <em>The New Yorker</em>, and he has appeared often on National Public Radio, CSPAN and MSNBC.<br><br>"A short, sour, brilliant little book... McWhorter makes all the right arguments, and he makes them clearly." --Adam Gopnik, <em>The New Yorker</em> <br><p></p><br>"[McWhorter] tackles linguistic determinism--the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis--head on, arguing that world views are human, not strapped to one culture." --<em>Nature</em> <br><p></p><br>"McWhorter is exhaustive, fair-minded, and convincing." --<em>Pacific Standard</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>The Language Hoax</em> has a sharp-edged title, but a generous and methodical approach to the evidence on both sides of the 'language-shapes-thought' debate. Nonetheless, John McWhorter has gathered the most comprehensive case for the prosecution out there, which will make both specialists and general readers think again. Besides being provoked, they will also be entertained by this wonderfully written book, which ends with the aim of redeeming our common humanity." --Robert Lane Greene, Language columnist, The Economist, and author of <em>You Are What You Speak: Grammar Grouches, Language Laws and</em> <em>the Politics of Identity</em> <br><p></p><br>"Some popular ideas are worse than wrong--they have a smidgen of truth on minor matters, but encourage misunderstandings of major matters. John McWhorter, one of our sharpest explainers of linguistics, shows that this is true of the chestnut that language shapes thought. Despite its superficial sophistication, the hypothesis conceals profound truths: that thought is far richer than language; that languages are products of capricious memetics rather than reflections of cultural obsessions; and that the cognitive similarities among people are deeper than their differences." --Steven Pinker, Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and author of <em>The Language Instinct</em> and <em>The Stuff of Thought</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>The Language Hoax</em> is a well-written and stimulating book that asks uncomfortable questions and turns common arguments on their head. The author uses examples from an impressive number of languages across the globe to provide counter-examples to claims that may easily be made (and occasionally have been made) about the influence of language on thought... McWhorter's thought-provoking manifesto provides much stuff to think about and keep the discussion on language, culture and thought going. It is suitable for both undergraduate and graduate classes (I just did it in one of mine, in combination with Deutscher's book), to provide answers to the -- yes, open -- question of whether the world looks different in other languages, or just the same in any language." --<em>LinguistList</em> <br><p></p><br>"To close, we applaud the depth of the author's manifesto in terms of the expansive literature coverage, historical developments, and implications for social science. We recommend it to anyone with an interest in language and thought who also likes a good read."-- <em>American Journal of Psychology</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>School Nursing: A Comprehensive Text</h2><p><ul><br> <li>Covers all aspects of the delivery of healthcare services to school-age children, adolescents, and staff.</li><br> <li>Illustrates the role of the school nurse as a vital link in the clinical management of child health care.</li><br> <li>Integrates components of the school health program throughout the text.</li><br> <li>Offers strategies or enhancing the school nurse&#x2019;s ability to take a leadership role in all school health programs.</li><br> <li>Provides information comprehensive enough to be applied in college health settings.</li><br> <li>Emphasizes clinical application of up-to-date, evidence-based pediatric, mental health and public health nursing as they relate to providing care in schools.</li><br> <li>Functions as an excellent resource for orientation to the role of the school nurse, and for one-day in-service or continuing education programs.<br> </li><br></ul></p><p></p><h2>Spring Awakening</h2><p><p>&#x201c;This brave new musical, haunting and electrifying by turns, restores the mystery, the thrill to that shattering transformation that stirs in all our souls.&#x201d;&#x2014;Charles Isherwood, <i>The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;The staggering purity of this show will touch all open hearts...In its refined, imaginative simplicity, it daringly reverses all the conventional rules by returning the American musical to an original state of innocence.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Heilpern, <i>The New York Observer</i></p><p>&#x201c;An unexpected jolt of sudden genius, edgy in its brutally honest, unromanticized depiction of human sexuality.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>New York Post</i></p><p> <i>Spring Awakening</i> is an extraordinary new rock musical with book and lyrics by Steven Sater and music by Grammy Award-nominated recording artist Duncan Sheik.

Spiked into the shifting sands, its billowing fabric roof dipped and swayed in the desert breeze. Inside the tent, a long table was centered on a wooden platform covered with a red-and-orange oriental rug. Five falcons with leather cords on their legs and suits of black armor across their bodies perched on the backs of chairs, silent and watchful.<br> <br>The air was scented with cardamom and grapes from the festive lunch the four men and two women had just enjoyed, mixing agreeably with the seared desert air around them; the quiet strains of Pink Floyd played in the background. Champagne cooled in silver buckets, awaiting the revelations to come.<br> <br>They spoke among themselves, occasionally laughing as they finished the sweet cream custard mixed with dates and almonds in small golden bowls. They laid their linen napkins beside their plates and drank the last superb bottle of 2010 Chateau L&#x2019;Evangile French Bordeaux.<br> <br>Conversation turned to the falcons and how very well-behaved the five were, all their attention on their master, who sat at the head of the table.<br> <br>Their master, the host of the party, was Roman Ardelean, an Englishman of Romanian descent, in his prime, tall, broad-shouldered, a beak of a nose, dark hair, and eyes like smudges of coal. He pushed back his chair. &#x201c;It is time, ladies, gentlemen. Come with me, and you will see the capabilities of our new army.&#x201d;<br> <br>Each of the six knew this was to be a demonstration and a celebration of what they were financing&#x2014;a drone army&#x2014;yet none knew exactly what to expect. It would be a lovely surprise for all of them, Roman knew. The investors&#x2014;the Money, as he thought of them&#x2014;followed him out into the desert, blinking in the blazing sun and immediately sweating. Behind the tent, twenty yards away, was a line of folding chairs. On each chair was a set of ear guards and large eye shields.<br> <br>Roman watched the Money take their seats, then turned his back and slipped a tiny stamp on his tongue, felt it melt, tasted the fleeting metallic hit. The microdose of LSD, a special version made for him by his twin, Radu, would help keep him calm and focused. It would also make the colors of the coming display more dramatic and the acrid desert air soften against his face, but no one needed to know that. He slipped the small box where he kept his tabs back into the pocket of his cargo pants and looked again at the Money. All were dressed as befitted a desert spa jaunt&#x2014;crisp new earth tones and neck scarves, all provided by Roman&#x2019;s company, Radulov Industries. The Money blended into the desert, looked like they were meant to be there, which Roman found amusing. But camouflage was important right now, for all of them.<br> <br>Once they were settled, Roman stood in front of them, hands behind his back. He was a clever man, a charming man, a leader who knew exactly what he was doing. He cleared his throat, met each set of eyes, and began to speak. His clear, commanding voice was exactly what the Money needed to hear, just as his tall, fit body was what they needed to see.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, I applaud all of you. You are patriots and visionaries. You all know what will become of us if the spread of radical Islam isn&#x2019;t halted. You have envisioned this future, so you were ready to place your resources in my hands to build a drone army. I gladly took on this challenge.<br> <br>&#x201c;What you&#x2019;re about to witness is the result of my efforts. The drones are the latest in personal defense stealth technology. They are my design, technologically so advanced not even our military has this capability yet. Despite these advancements, they are easily manned by even the most inexperienced operator. You don&#x2019;t need pilots with thousands of sorties behind them to navigate these babies.<br> <br>&#x201c;They also have internal gyroscopes allowing them to maintain a constant horizon, which means they cannot be accidentally crashed. You can hand the controls to ten-year-olds, and they&#x2019;ll be able to fly them with ease. Of course, most of the ten-year-olds we know are so advanced with their computer games that this might seem boring to them.&#x201d; Pause, laughter all around.<br> <br>&#x201c;But not the children where we&#x2019;re sending these beauties. No, they have nothing to help defend themselves against the constant encroachment of the terrorists. Nothing but leftover weapons from failed wars, guns that barely work, if at all. Thanks to all of you, we&#x2019;re about to change that.<br> <br>&#x201c;It is our goal to stop the incessant march of radical Islam across Africa, across these small disadvantaged countries with no hope of fighting it. We are going to arm the people so they can defend themselves. What Britain and the United States refuse to do, we will do for them. Covertly, quietly, and most importantly, cost-effectively. I will have no overruns on project costs, no excuses, no delays. When you decided to go with Radulov, I guaranteed the massive drone army would be built. And this is my promise, my investment in this amazing venture.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is what all of you wanted, what all of you agreed to, and why you hired me to make it a reality.<br> <br>&#x201c;And yes, everything you&#x2019;re about to see here is beyond classified. I am going to pass out nondisclosure agreements for you to sign. This will assure me that even if you want to talk about these weapons, you cannot without disclosing your involvement in their development. None of your own investors would regard this with a favorable eye, to say the least, nor would the government. Call it an insurance policy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Whispers and outright hostility swept through the group.<br> <br>Roman&#x2019;s partner, Corinthian Jones, Lord Barstow, late of Her Majesty&#x2019;s Security Services and now a consultant for the Crown, was shaking his head. &#x201c;Roman, do you think it is necessary? As you said, I brought these six patriots to you to build this drone army in the first place. Of course they will keep silent about their involvement.&#x201d;<br> <br>Be quiet, you old fool, I know what I&#x2019;m doing. &#x201c;My lord, I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll understand when I say this is for my protection, as well as all of yours. We all know what happened when the Americans tried to arm the Contras. It turned into the scandal of the century, and a patriot had to fall on his sword. I have no desire to be that man. As such, I&#x2019;d hardly fail to protect my interests on such a large investment, and neither would you. And as you know, this is a very large investment, for all of us.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, we need to get started before the sun sets. Please sign the nondisclosure agreements, pass them back to me, put on your ear guards and goggles, and let&#x2019;s get this show started.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was still grumbling, particularly from Paulina Vittorini, the Madonna bitch, as he thought of her, but finally even she signed the agreement. He wondered idly if he was the richest among the six of them. His firm, Radulov Industries, manufactured cybersecurity software that resided on almost every modern computer in the world. Apple and Microsoft now shipped with Radulov&#x2019;s flagship program MATRIX already installed as part of their most recent operating systems. In many ways, he&#x2019;d saved the computer age from hackers and terrorists.<br> <br>Not that he wasn&#x2019;t humble about it all, at least in public.<br> <br>It was fitting he&#x2019;d made his money in cybersecurity, because cyber warfare was the next&#x2014;the only&#x2014;logical step. The terrorists had their own weaponry, their own drones and IEDs&#x2014;improvised explosive devices&#x2014;and, in some extreme cases, planes. They moved through the dark web unseen, unstoppable, buying and selling drugs and weapons, accumulating wealth and influence, recruiting more and more lost souls to their cause.<br> <br>Roman&#x2019;s entire life had been built on preventing the flow of negative information, stopping black hat hackers in their tracks, protecting the vulnerable, the ignorant, the gullible. His values had made him rich; his brilliance and charm had made him popular. In the last piece Forbes did on Roman and Radulov Industries, they&#x2019;d called him Cyber Superman&#x2014;he was Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Elon Musk rolled into a single brain, with a touch of Tony Stark&#x2019;s humorous arrogance. He&#x2019;d liked that.<br> <br>When Barstow had approached Roman about an off-book black-ops program he&#x2019;d pictured in his mind&#x2014;specifically, putting together a private drone army to help the smaller countries the United Kingdom wasn&#x2019;t able to legally protect&#x2014;Roman was impressed. He&#x2019;d jumped at the chance to stop the evil that was spreading unchecked across Africa.<br> <br>Barstow had quietly assembled the Money&#x2014;the six people here for the demonstration who would fund the operation, if, that is, they were impressed enough to transfer half the total funds required to a special account Barstow had set up. When the drone army was ready to ship, the other half of its total cost, two billion pounds, would be paid. Barstow had also assured him the Money had the resources to move the drones into place. As for Lord Barstow, he referred to himself as Roman&#x2019;s partner, a small conceit Roman allowed him. He would remain the financial bridge between the Money and Roman. He himself wasn&#x2019;t rich, merely comfortable, but through his title, lineage, and government contacts, he knew everyone who counted. Roman was amazed Barstow had the brains and guts to set this plan into motion and equally amazed he&#x2019;d managed to convince six wealthy people to pay for it.<br> <br>It was the make-or-break moment for Roman, but he wasn&#x2019;t worried. It was the perfect time&#x2014;the sun was beginning to set, the sky turning lovely shades of pink and orange, signaling the ending of a very good day. It was time to show Barstow and the Money what they were going to get for their incredible investment of two billion pounds.<br> <br>In the distance, there was a small village crafted by Roman&#x2019;s people, no living souls inside, of course, with everything a small desert village would have&#x2014;huts, cardboard people and goats, even a rooster, several large outbuildings for livestock. They&#x2019;d spent three weeks here in the bloody-hot desert putting it all together.<br> <br>Roman grinned to himself.<br> <br>Now came the fun part.<br> <br>He nodded to Cyrus Wendell, his right hand for nearly ten years now. Cyrus had worked with him on the development of the drones. He was the only one of Roman&#x2019;s people he trusted to be there for the demonstration. Cyrus pressed a button on the laptop. Roman lifted his arm, now encased in leather. His wrist held what looked like a small computer keyboard and screen.<br> <br>&#x201c;All of the weapons are remotely operated through a computer program I&#x2019;ve written, controlled by this small device on my forearm. As you can see, this weapons system is portable, discreet&#x2014;you could even take it on a commercial airline flight.

These measures concern me, though. Are you expecting people to try to steal the technology off our wrists?&#x201d;<br> <br>Roman smiled, a hint of flirt on his face. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t you? I take nothing for granted in this world, Ms. Vittorini. Protecting my people and their technology is paramount.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, let me show you what you&#x2019;ll be getting for your buy-ins.&#x201d;<br> <br>Roman pressed the button on his wrist, said nothing, waited three seconds.<br> <br>It sounded like a swarm of bees, coming closer, closer. The murmurs stopped. The five falcons went on alert, but with a muted command from their master, sat back, yellow eyes watchful.<br> <br>Seemingly out of nowhere, the drones flew directly over the tent and the presentation space, then stopped and hovered overhead. Roman had included six different breeds&#x2014;he saw the drones like he saw his five falcons: each had a strength, a pedigree, a purpose. From his tiny hovering dragonfly-like Night Hawk to the fifteen-foot long flagship, the Geode, each rose up in unison and got in line, ready for his command.<br> <br>&#x201c;Off you go,&#x201d; Roman said quietly, pressed a button, and they were over the makeshift village in a few moments.<br> <br>The drones circled their targets, shooting off their specific weapons&#x2014;one dropping IEDs on the village, another landing and placing a bomb on the ground before soaring back into the air. Gunfire spurted out of another, loud and deadly, then was almost drowned out by the whistle of a missile launching from the Geode. To the delight of the Money, the small fabricated city and all its cardboard props were destroyed within a minute. Roman swiped a finger on the screen, and the strikes stopped. The drones came back toward them, hovering serenely twenty feet in the air.<br> <br>Roman handed off the biometric glove to Barstow, who pulled it on and flew the Geode through the skies, trying hard to crash it, marveling at the auto-stabilization, then, as Roman watched, Barstow smiled slyly and dropped a hellfire missile on the city&#x2019;s smoking ruins.<br> <br>As flames shot into the quickening night, the Money burst into applause, talking over one another, surprise, awe. It pleased Roman inordinately.<br> <br>Chapman Donovan said in his gravelly smoker&#x2019;s voice, &#x201c;Ardelean, this is brilliant&#x2014;well done. Well done, indeed. Ah, together, we will halt radical Islam in its tracks! All of you, do we give Mr. Ardelean the go-ahead?&#x201d;<br> <br>Applause and enthusiastic nods all around.<br> <br>Vittorini asked, &#x201c;What does the little drone do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Night Hawk is a personal-protection drone capable of delivering a needle-size weapon into the neck of a target from twenty-five yards away. So if you need to assassinate someone, you&#x2019;ll want to order a few of them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Barstow laughed, almost too heartily, gave Roman an avuncular smile, and slapped him on the shoulder. &#x201c;And whom among us knows when such a need might arise? You&#x2019;ve thought of everything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, my lord. I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re pleased. Now, I have one last display for you before we get down to business.&#x201d;<br> <br>Roman gestured with his hand and gave a short whistle. With a piercing shriek, the falcons took off as one, as if they, too, were programmed by Roman&#x2019;s computers. The Money gasped in surprise when the falcons attacked the drones, swooping down, grabbing them by their bellies and whipping them to the ground. Within a few minutes, Roman&#x2019;s small drone army was destroyed.<br> <br>He loved the looks of shock on their faces and said, in his charming leader&#x2019;s voice, an eyebrow arched, &#x201c;You were not expecting a counteroffensive? We must have a proper defense to protect us from the future of unmanned warfare. If the terrorists attack us with their drones, there is nothing we can do but try to shoot them out of the sky, which rarely works. Properly trained falcons and eagles, on the other hand, can watch for incoming drones and eliminate them before they get anywhere near their targets.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was p...</p><h2>Princeless: Save Yourself (Princeless, 1)</h2><p>&#x201c;Funny riffs on adventure story stereotypes fill this graphic novel, and parents and educators will be delighted with the diverse characters.&#x201d; - AMightyGirl.com<br><br>Honored as an Amelia Bloomer Project title, through the ALA.<br><br>Adrienne Ashe never wanted to be a princess.

She's the seventh daughter whom her father, the king, has stranded in a tower (his goal is to lure a prince worthy to rule the kingdom of Ashland). Prince after prince has tried to rescue Adrienne, and after Prince Wilcome's failed attempt, she decides to save herself. Along with her protector dragon, Adrienne decides to save her sisters, but their first mission is to find some armor. Blacksmith Bedelia Smith joins their group with her armor-for-ladies collection, and the princess also lets her brother, Prince Devin, in on her plan. After his failed rescue attempt, the very charming Prince Wilcome is banished to the palace's dungeon, but he doesn't bargain on Shadira the elf tricking him into helping her escape. This volume includes the first four issues of the dynamic and female-empowering comic book series. Princess Adrienne is a strong woman of color, and she talks about her femininity in a fresh and fierce new way. Other characters are drawn well, and the side stories of Bedelia Smith, Prince Wilcome, and Prince Devin are engaging. On the whole, the series feels current and skewers well-known tropes.

The answers are not always straightforward. For some women, the issue is as simple as not really thinking through what they re looking for or should be looking for in a man. Others feel they'd rather be with someone (and pretty much anyone will do) than be alone, while still others are unconsciously replicating patterns of bad relationships they learned in childhood or from traumatic experiences and don't know how to stop the cycle.</p><p> Deepak Reju, writing from his years of experience as a pastor and a counselor, shares with women his perspective on how to assess a relationship's strengths from the beginning, how to identity possible pitfalls, and how to have the courage to not just settle but to wait for a relationship that will be a blessing to both of you.</p><p> This Christian outlook on modern day relationship troubles will help you to understand why even smart, Christian women settle, what sort of man to look out for, gaining the strength from God to breakup bad relationships, why waiting is ok and how God helps you and more. <em>She's Got The Wrong Guy</em> is a must read to give you guidance from God to help you find a gospel focused man.</p></p><p>Deepak Reju, MDiv, PhD, serves as the pastor of biblical counseling and families at Capitol Hill Baptist Church (CHBC) in Washington, DC, as well as president for the board of directors of the Biblical Counseling Coalition. He is the author of several books and articles, including Great Kings of the Bible, The Pastor and Counseling, and On Guard: Preventing and Responding to Child Abuse at Church. Deepak and his wife Sarah have five children.<p>"As a biblical counselor and a woman who didn't marry until age forty-two, I've seen many of my beloved single friends make choices regarding dating and marriage they later came to regret. It's my hope that the heartache experienced by many single women will be averted because of the wisdom Deepak offers in this book. Whether you're a single woman or not, you'll find this book is for you-because it's all about being grounded in Christ."</p> <p><strong>Amy Baker, </strong>Ministry Resource Director, Faith Church; Counselor at Faith Biblical Counseling Ministries; author of <em>Picture Perfect </em>and <em>Getting to the Heart of Friendships</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"Deepak has written a much-needed word to single women which is full of biblical truth and wisdom. His wealth of experience has given him the ability to write with understanding and conviction as he encourages young women to pursue Christ, patiently trust God's plan, and depend on his grace while they wait on him. I highly recommend this book full of prudent warnings, poignant examples and godly counsel to single women.</p> <p><strong>David and Sally Michael, </strong>Cofounder of Children Desiring God</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"Dr. Reju has turned the topic of dating on its head with this insightful and thoughtful look at who not to marry. As a seasoned counselor and brother in Christ, he walks single Christian women through a methodical process of considering the dangers of settling. Using compelling case studies, Deepak carefully leads them to consider many biblical factors that are sometimes swept away as insignificant while encouraging smart women to be patient in waiting for God's best."</p> <p><strong>Mary K. Mohler, </strong>President's Wife, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary; Director of Seminary Wives Institute</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"With the wisdom that comes from hours and hours of counseling brokenhearted women, the biblical insight that springs from years in the Scriptures, and the compassion that flows out of the heart of a follower of Jesus, Deepak has written a sensitive and important book for women who want to be married and might be tempted to settle for someone . . . anyone . . . who will take away the loneliness. Sisters, if you're considering who you should date (and ultimately marry), let me encourage you to read this book first and to take Deepak's counsel to heart.

Tudahl presents a day-by-day description of Prince&#x2019;s live shows and his studio work from the release of his album 1999 in late 1982 to the making and release of the album and movie Purple Rain in late 1984. Tudahl opens the doors at L.A.&#x2019;s Sunset Sound studios and provides insider glimpses into Prince&#x2019;s recording processes. According to the original work order for the session for 'When Doves Cry,' Prince recorded the song in a single day; it became his first number one hit. Producer Peggy McCreary, interviewed here, says Prince knew exactly what he was doing and knew he had a hit. For each recording session, Tudahl lists the studio and some elements of the song being laid down, as well as the names of the producers and engineers. Prince fans will most enjoy Tudahl&#x2019;s thorough archival work; his fascinating book offers a portrait of an artist continually seeking to grow creatively and maintain control over his musical identity.

Prince expert Tudahl points out that although most people link Prince with his Paisley Park home studio in Minnesota, his biggest albums were in fact recorded at Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles. Tudahl&#x2019;s granular study of Prince during his 1983 and 1984 recording sessions covers the production not only of Purple Rain and Around the World in a Day as well as &#x2018;Little Red Corvette,&#x2019; &#x2018;When Doves Cry,&#x2019; &#x2018;Raspberry Beret,&#x2019; and many B-sides but also recordings by the Time, Sheila E., the Bangles, Sheena Easton, and Stevie Nicks. Tudahl also describes more than 100 live performances and rehearsals by Prince during this fruitful two-year period and discusses the Purple Rain film soundtrack and the origins of the movie. Tudahl conducted hundreds of hours of interviews with Prince&#x2019;s former band members, studio engineers, and others.

(<i>The Huffington Post</i>)<br><br>4 1/2 Stars<br><br>Though it covers just two years in Prince&#x2019;s life, Prince and the Purple Rain Era Studio Sessions is, hands-down, the most exhaustive study of the most crucial period in Prince&#x2019;s career. It also sets the scene for what looks set to become a series of books that, depending on how much ground they up covering, will likely obliterate the need for another serious critical study of the Purple One&#x2019;s work. In over 20 years of graft, Duane Tudahl has interviewed almost anyone who recorded with, helped facilitate the dreams of, or got a perfumed whiff of Prince during his time coming off the cult-level success of 1999 and gearing up for the globe-shattering triumph of Purple Rain.... With Prince now unable to ever tell his own story, Tudahl and his interviewees are lifting the veil with love, in order for the rest of the world to understand what a genius he was. In doing so, a bar has been set that, frankly, it looks like only he himself will be able to reach. The next volume can&#x2019;t come soon enough.<br><br>Five Stars.

Simply put, the work Tudahl has done on this book is astounding. Books like these help keep Prince&#x2019;s legacy alive and remind us what a special artist he was.

The only way to return to Rome is to pledge his support to a charismatic and dangerous enemy: Julius Caesar. Harnessing his political cunning, unrivalled intellect, and the sheer brilliance of his words, Cicero fights his way back to prominence. Yet no public figure is completely safeguarded against the unscrupulous ambition of others.&nbsp;<br><br> Riveting and tumultuous,&nbsp;Dictator&nbsp;encompasses the most epic events in ancient history, including the collapse of the Roman Republic, the murder of Pompey, and the assassination of Caesar. But its central question is a timeless one: how to keep political freedom unsullied by personal gain, vested interests, and the corrosive effects of ceaseless foreign wars. In Robert Harris&#x2019;s indelible portrait, Cicero is a deeply fascinating hero for his own time and for ours.</p><p><b>ROBERT HARRIS&nbsp;</b>is the author of nine best-selling novels: <i>Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, Imperium, The Ghost Writer, Conspirata,</i> <i>The Fear Index, </i>and <i>An Officer and a Spy</i>. Several of his books have been adapted to film, most recently <i>The Ghost Writer, </i>directed by Roman Polanski. His work has been translated into thirty-seven languages. He lives in the village of Kintbury, England, with his wife, Gill Hornby.I<br><br>I remember the cries of caesar&#x2019;s war-horns chasing us over the darkened fields of Latium&#x2014;their yearning, keening howls, like animals in heat&#x2014;and how when they stopped there was only the slither of our shoes on the icy road and the urgent panting of our breath.<br><br>It was not enough for the immortal gods that Cicero should be spat at and reviled by his fellow citizens; not enough that in the middle of the night he be driven from the hearths and altars of his family and ancestors; not enough even that as we fled from Rome on foot he should look back and see his house in flames. To all these torments they deemed it necessary to add one further refinement: that he should be forced to hear his enemy&#x2019;s army striking camp on the Field of Mars.<br><br>Even though he was the oldest of our party Cicero kept up the same fast pace as the rest of us. Not long ago he had held Caesar&#x2019;s life in the palm of his hand. He could have crushed it as easily as an egg. Now their fortunes led them in entirely opposite directions. While Cicero hurried south to escape his enemies, the architect of his destruction marched north to take command of both provinces of Gaul.<br><br>He walked with his head down, not uttering a word and I imagined it was because he was too full of despair to speak. Only at dawn, when we rendezvoused with our horses at Bovillae and were about to embark on the second stage of our escape, did he pause with his foot in the doorway of his carriage and say suddenly, &#x201c;Do you think we should turn back?&#x201d;<br><br>The question caught me by surprise. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t considered it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, consider it now. Tell me: why are we fleeing Rome?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of Clodius and his mob.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And why is Clodius so powerful?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s a tribune and can pass laws against you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And who made it possible for him to become a tribune?&#x201d;<br><br>I hesitated. &#x201c;Caesar.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. Caesar. Do you imagine that man&#x2019;s departure for Gaul at that precise hour was a coincidence? Of course not! He waited till his spies had reported I&#x2019;d left the city before ordering his army to move. Why? I&#x2019;d always assumed his advancement of Clodius was to punish me for speaking out against him. But what if his real aim all along was to drive me out of Rome? What scheme requires him to be certain I&#x2019;ve gone before he can leave too?&#x201d;<br><br>I should have grasped the logic of what he was saying. I should have urged him to turn back. But I was too exhausted to reason clearly. And if I am honest there was more to it than that. I was too afraid of what Clodius&#x2019;s thugs might do to us if they caught us re-entering the city.<br><br>So instead I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good question, and I can&#x2019;t pretend I have the answer. But wouldn&#x2019;t it look indecisive, after bidding goodbye to everyone, suddenly to reappear? In any case, Clodius has burned your house down now&#x2014;where would we return to? Who would take us in? I think you&#x2019;d be wiser to stick to your original plan and get as far away from Rome as you can.&#x201d;<br><br>He rested his head against the side of the carriage and closed his eyes. In the pale grey light I was shocked by how haggard he appeared after his night on the road. His hair and beard had not been cut for weeks. He was wearing a toga dyed black. Although he was only in his forty-ninth year, these public signs of mourning made him look much older&#x2014;like some ancient, mendicant holy man. After a while he sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Tiro. Perhaps you&#x2019;re right. It&#x2019;s so long since I slept I&#x2019;m too tired to think any more.&#x201d;<br><br>And so the fatal error was made&#x2014;more through indecision than decision&#x2014;and we continued to press on southwards for the remainder of that day and for the twelve days that followed, putting what we thought was a safe distance between ourselves and danger.<br><br>We travelled with a minimal entourage to avoid attracting attention&#x2014;just the carriage driver and three armed slaves on horseback, one in front and two behind. A small chest of gold and silver coins that Atticus, Cicero&#x2019;s oldest and closest friend, had provided to pay for our journey was hidden under our seat. We stayed only in the houses of men we trusted, no more than a night in each, and steered clear of those places where Cicero might have been expected to stop&#x2014;for example at his seaside villa at Formiae, the first place any pursuers would look for him, and along the Bay of Naples, already filling with the annual exodus from Rome in search of winter sun and warm springs. Instead we headed as fast as we could towards the toe of Italy.<br><br>Cicero&#x2019;s plan, conceived on the move, was to make for Sicily and stay there until the political agitation against him in Rome subsided. &#x201c;The mob will turn on Clodius eventually,&#x201d; he predicted. &#x201c;Such is the unalterable nature of the mob. He will always be my mortal enemy but he won&#x2019;t always be tribune&#x2014;we must never forget that. In nine months his term of office will expire and then we can go back.&#x201d;<br><br>He was confident of a friendly reception from the Sicilians, if only because of his successful prosecution of the island&#x2019;s tyrannical governor, Verres&#x2014;even though that brilliant victory, which launched his political career, was now twelve years in the past and Clodius had more recently been a magistrate in the province. I sent letters ahead giving notice of his intention to seek sanctuary, and when we reached the harbour at Regium we hired a little six-oared boat to row us across the straits to Messina.<br><br>We left the harbour on a clear cold winter morning of searing blues&#x2014;the sea and the sky; one light, one dark; the line dividing them as sharp as a blade; the distance to Messina a mere three miles. It took us less than an hour. We drew so close we could see Cicero&#x2019;s supporters lined up on the rocks to welcome him. But stationed between us and the entrance to the port was a warship flying the red and green colours of the governor of Sicily, Gaius Vergilius, and as we approached the lighthouse it slipped its anchor and moved slowly forwards to intercept us. Vergilius stood at the rail surrounded by his lictors and, after visibly recoiling at Cicero&#x2019;s dishevelled appearance, shouted down a greeting, to which Cicero replied in friendly terms. They had known one another in the Senate for many years.<br><br>Vergilius asked him his intentions.<br><br>Cicero called back that naturally he intended to come ashore.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d heard,&#x201d; replied Vergilius. &#x201c;Unhappily I can&#x2019;t allow it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of Clodius&#x2019;s new law.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what new law would that be? There are so many, one loses count.&#x201d;<br><br>Vergilius beckoned to a member of his staff who produced a document and leaned down to pass it to me and I then gave it to Cicero. To this day I can remember how it fluttered in his hands in the slight breeze as if it were a living thing; it was the only sound in the silence. He took his time and when he had finished reading it he handed it to me without comment.<br><br>Lex Clodia in Ciceronem<br><br>Whereas M. T. Cicero has put Roman citizens to death unheard and uncondemned; and to that end forged the authority and decree of the Senate; it is hereby ordained that he be interdicted from fire and water to a distance of four hundred miles from Rome; that nobody should presume to harbour or receive him, on pain of death; that all his property and possessions be forfeit; that his house in Rome be demolished and a shrine to Liberty consecrated in its place; and that whoever shall move, speak, vote or take any step towards recalling him shall be treated as a public enemy, unless those whom Cicero unlawfully put to death should first spring back to life.<br><br>It must have been the most terrible blow. But he found the composure to dismiss it with a flick of his hand. &#x201c;When,&#x201d; he enquired, &#x201c;was this nonsense published?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m told it was posted in Rome eight days ago. It came into my hands yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s not law yet, and can&#x2019;t be law until it&#x2019;s been read a third time. My secretary will confirm it. Tiro,&#x201d; he said, turning to me, &#x201c;tell the governor the earliest date it can be passed.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried to calculate. Before a bill could be put to a vote it had to be read aloud in the Forum on three successive market days. But my reasoning was so shaken by what I had just read I couldn&#x2019;t remember what day of the week it was now, let alone when the market days fell. &#x201c;Twenty days from today,&#x201d; I hazarded, &#x201c;perhaps twenty-five?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d; cried Cicero. &#x201c;I have three weeks&#x2019; grace even if it passes, which I&#x2019;m sure it won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He stood up in the prow of the boat, bracing his legs against the rocking of the hull, and spread his arms wide in appeal. &#x201c;Please, my dear Vergilius, for the sake of our past friendship, now that I have come so far, at least allow me to land and spend a night or two with my supporters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, as I say, I&#x2019;m sorry, but I cannot take the risk. I&#x2019;ve consulted my experts. They say even if you travelled to the very western tip of the island, to Lilybaeum, you&#x2019;d still be within three hundred and fifty miles of Rome, and then Clodius would come after me.&#x201d;<br><br>At that, Cicero ceased to be so friendly. He said coldly, &#x201c;You have no right under the law to impede the journey of a Roman citizen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have every right to safeguard the tranquillity of my province. And here, as you know, my word is the law . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He was apologetic. I dare say he was even embarrassed. But he was immovable, and after a few more angry exchanges there was nothing for it but to turn round and row back to Regium. Our departure provoked a great cry of dismay from the shoreline and I could see that Cicero for the first time was seriously worried. Vergilius was a friend of his. If this was how a friend reacted then soon the whole of Italy would be closed against him. Returning to Rome to oppose the law was much too risky. He had left it too late. Apart from the physical danger such a journey would entail, the bill would almost certainly pass, and then we would be stranded four hundred miles from the legal limit it prescribed. To comply safely with the terms of his exile he would have to flee abroad immediately. Obviously Gaul was out of the question because of Caesar. So it would have to be somewhere in the East&#x2014;Greece perhaps, or Asia. But unfortunately we were on the wrong side of the peninsula to make our escape in the treacherous winter seas. We needed to get over to the opposite coast, to Brundisium on the Adriatic, and find a big ship capable of making a lengthy voyage. Our predicament was exquisitely vile&#x2014;as no doubt Caesar, the original sponsor and creator of Clodius, had intended.<br><br>it took us two weeks of arduous travel to cross the mountains, often in heavy rain and mostly along bad roads. Every mile seemed fraught with the hazard of ambush, although the primi�tive little towns we passed through were welcoming enough. At night we slept in smoky, freezing inns and dined on hard bread and fatty meat made scarcely more palatable by sour wine. Cicero&#x2019;s mood veered between fury and despair. He saw clearly now that he had made a terrible mistake by leaving Rome. It had been madness for him to quit the city and leave Clodius free to spread the calumny that he had put citizens to death &#x201c;unheard and uncondemned&#x201d; when in fact each of the five Catiline conspirators had been allowed to speak in his own defence and their execution had been sanctioned by the entire Senate. But his flight was tantamount to an admission of guilt. He should have obeyed his instinct and turned back when he heard Caesar&#x2019;s departing trumpets and first began to realise his error. He wept at the disaster his folly and timidity had brought upon his wife and children.<br><br>And when he had finished lashing himself, he turned his scourge on Hortensius &#x201c;and the rest of the aristocratic gang,&#x201d; who had never forgiven him for rising from his humble origins to the consulship and saving the republic: they had deliberately urged him to flee in order to ruin him. He should have heeded the example of Socrates, who said that death was preferable to exile. Yes, he should have killed himself! He snatched up a knife from the dining table. He would kill himself! I said nothing. I didn&#x2019;t take the threat seriously. He couldn&#x2019;t stand the sight of others&#x2019; blood, let alone his own. All his life he had tried to avoid military expeditions, the games, public executions, funerals&#x2014;anything that might remind him of mortality. If pain frightened him, death terrified him&#x2014;which, although I would never have been impertinent enough to point it out, was the principal reason we had fled Rome in the first place.<br><br>When finally we came within sight of the fortified walls of Brundisium, he decided not to venture inside. The port was so large and busy, so full of strangers, and so likely to be his desti�n�ation, he was convinced it was the obvious spot for his assassination. Instead we sought sanctuary a little way up the coast, in the residence of his old friend Marcus Laenius Flaccus. That night we slept in decent beds for the first time in three weeks, and the next morning we went down to the beach. The waves were much rougher than on the Sicilian side. A strong wind was hurling the Adriatic relentlessly against the rocks and shingle. Cicero loathed sea voyages at the best of times; this one promised to be especially treacherous. Yet it was our only means of escape. One hundred and twenty miles beyond the horizon lay the shore of Illyricum.<br><br>Flaccus, noticing his expression, said, &#x201c;Fortify your spirits, Cicero&#x2014;perhaps the bill won&#x2019;t pass, or one of the other tribunes will veto it. There must be someone left in Rome willing to stand up for you&#x2014;Pompey, surely?&#x201d;<br><br>But Cicero, his gaze still fixed out to sea, made no reply, and a few days later we heard that the bill had indeed become law and that Flaccus was therefore guilty of a capital offence simply by having a convicted exile on his premises. Even so he tried to persuade us to stay. He insisted that Clodius didn&#x2019;t frighten him. But Cicero wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it: &#x201c;Your loyalty moves me, old friend, but that monster will have dispatched a team of his hired fighters to hunt me down the moment his law passed. There is no time to lose.&#x201d;<br><br>I had found a merchant ship in the harbour at Brundisium whose hard-pressed master was willing to risk a winter voyage across the Adriatic in return for a huge fee, and the next morning at first light, when no one was around, we went on board. She was a sturdy, broad-beamed vessel, with a crew of about twenty, used to ply the trade route between Italy and Dyrrachium. I was no judge of these things, but she looked safe enough to me. The master estimated the crossing would require a day and a half&#x2014;but we needed to leave quickly, he said, and take advantage of the favourable wind. So while the sailors made her ready and Flaccus waited on the quayside, Cicero quickly dictated a final message to his wife and children: It has been a fine life, a great career&#x2014;the good in me, nothing bad, has brought me down. My dear Terentia, loyalest and best of wives, my darling daughter Tullia, and little Marcus, our one remaining hope&#x2014;goodbye! I copied it out and passed it up to Flaccus. He raised his hand in farewell. Then the sail was unfurled, the cables cast off, the oarsmen pushed us away from the harbour wall, and we set off into the pale grey light.<br><br>at first we made good speed. cicero stood high above the deck on the steersmen&#x2019;s platform, leaning on the stern rail, watching the great lighthouse of Brundisium recede behind us. Apart from his visits to Sicily, it was the first time he had left Italy since his youth, when he went to Rhodes to learn oratory from Molon. Of all the men I ever knew, Cicero was the least equipped by temperament for exile. To thrive he needed the appurtenances of civilised society&#x2014;friends, news...</p><h2>Star Stuff: Carl Sagan and the Mysteries of the Cosmos</h2><p><p>For every child who has ever looked up at the stars and asked, "What are they?" comes the story of a curious boy who never stopped wondering: Carl Sagan.</p><p>When Carl Sagan was a young boy he went to the 1939 World's Fair and his life was changed forever. From that day on he never stopped marveling at the universe and seeking to understand it better. <i>Star Stuff</i> follows Carl from his days star gazing from the bedroom window of his Brooklyn apartment, through his love of speculative science fiction novels, to his work as an internationally renowned scientist who worked on the Voyager missions exploring the farthest reaches of space. This book introduces the beloved man who brought the mystery of the cosmos into homes across America to a new generation of dreamers and star gazers.</p></p><p>When I was a kid, science was a dull subject to me. It seemed distant and unrelatable . Then, in 1980, something happened that changed how I thought about science: <i>Carl Sagan's Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</i> aired on TV. &nbsp;<i>Cosmos</i> changed everything- Carl Sagan was able to ignite imagination and wonder and pull science out of the the antiseptic staleness it existed in in my classroom and make it relevant to me and millions of people around the globe. &nbsp;In Cosmos, Carl Sagan explained that the stars in the night sky are related to us- that we too are made of the same stuff- star stuff. &nbsp;Carl Sagan forever change the way that I experience the world. &nbsp;I think of &nbsp;<i>STAR STUFF: Carl Sagan and the Mysteries of the Cosmos</i>, &nbsp;as an introduction to the life of this great man and as a thank you from a grateful kid.Stephanie Roth Sisson is an artist who has illustrated many books for children, most recently&nbsp;the Princess Posey chapter book series. <i>Star Stuff</i> is the first picture book that she has both written and illustrated.

Though forged by conquest, this vast domain depended for its political survival on a fundamental reshaping of Chinese culture. With this informative book, we are present at the creation of an ancient imperial order whose major features would endure for two millennia.</p><p>The Qin and Han constitute the "classical period" of Chinese history--a role played by the Greeks and Romans in the West. Mark Edward Lewis highlights the key challenges faced by the court officials and scholars who set about governing an empire of such scale and diversity of peoples. He traces the drastic measures taken to transcend, without eliminating, these regional differences: the invention of the emperor as the divine embodiment of the state; the establishment of a common script for communication and a state-sponsored canon for the propagation of Confucian ideals; the flourishing of the great families, whose domination of local society rested on wealth, landholding, and elaborate kinship structures; the demilitarization of the interior; and the impact of non-Chinese warrior-nomads in setting the boundaries of an emerging Chinese identity.</p><p>The first of a six-volume series on the history of imperial China, <i>The Early Chinese Empires</i> illuminates many formative events in China's long history of imperialism--events whose residual influence can still be discerned today.</p></p><p><p>Mark Edward Lewis is Kwoh-Ting Li Professor in Chinese Culture at Stanford University.</p><p>Timothy Brook is Professor of History and Republic of China Chair at the University of British Columbia.</p>&#x201c;As the first volume in the History of Imperial China, <i>The Early Chinese Empires</i> sets an authoritative, reliable tone that bodes well for this important new series. The book meets a high standard of historical accuracy and covers an impressively broad range of topics.

Now Harvard University Press has announced a six-volume series that will cover the rise, development, and decline of dynastic China from the second century B.C.E. through the early 20th century in an up-to-date, compact, and approachable way. This opening volume by Lewis foretells that the series will become the new gold standard, as the author explains in clear and telling detail how the Qin dynasty ruthlessly defeated a succession of rivals to unify briefly what we now call China in 221 B.C.E. We then see how the succeeding Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.-220 C.E.) combined social engineering and political savvy to institutionalize control and form a 'classical' era parallel to the Greeks and Romans in the West. Han imperial structures, including religion, literature, and law, were quite different from what evolved out of them, but Lewis convincingly argues that later societies cannot be understood without understanding this classical foundation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Charles W.

The first two groups of stories deal with the Pleiades and the Big Dipper; thereafter, they are organized by geographic area. Each group has introductory notes about the tribes of the area and their general beliefs, providing a context for the legends which follow. Notes at the end of each section correlate Indian and Western names for constellations and stars whenever possible. In addition to tales from well-known tribes such as Navajo and Mohawk, there are selections from Tlingit, Wasco, Picuris, and other small groups. Coyote appears in many of the tales, causing trouble whenever he appears. Wolves, bears, eagles, and other animals also inhabit the storiesand the night sky. The book is decorated with black-and-white drawings of a variety of Indian symbols, of the constellations, and of animals and people, which lend life and movement to the pages. Similar to Star Tales (Walker, 1987) by Gretchen Will Mayo, this volume is more comprehensive and better documented, a book that will not only be useful for assignments, but provide many hours of reading and listening pleasure.

Any member of the LDS Church today who enters the practice of polygamy is immediately excommunicated. However, Pearson claims, polygamy itself has never been excommunicated, but has an honored and protected place at the table. It has only been postponed, a fact confirmed by thousands of &#x201c;eternal sealings&#x201d; giving a man an assurance that he will claim as wives in heaven the two, three, or even more women he has sequentially married during his lifetime. No such opportunity is available to women. Through her own personal stories, those of her ancestors, and the thousands of stories that came to her through an Internet survey, Pearson shows the power of the Ghost of Eternal Polygamy as it not only waits on the other side to greet the most righteous in heaven, but also haunts the living&#x2014;hiding in the recesses of the Mormon psyche, inflicting profound pain and fear, assuring women that they are still objects, harming or destroying marriages, bringing chaos to family relationships, leading many to lose faith in the church and in God. Mormon historian and author Dr. Gregory Prince says of The Ghost of Eternal Polygamy: &#x201c;Carol Lynn Pearson has hit a home run in her quest to illuminate both the damage that Mormonism&#x2019;s de facto practice of polygamy continues to inflict, and the route to a better, more humane place. Those who truly hope for eternal polygamy or who resent any call to institutional reform will be upset, but countless others will rejoice that she has shown &#x2018;a more excellent way.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>Carol Lynn Pearson is the author of more than 40 books and plays that together have sold over 800,000 copies&#x2014;autobiography, inspiration, humor and novellas. She claims to have been &#x201c;born into women&#x2019;s issues&#x201d; and &#x201c;married into gay issues,&#x201d; both of which she has fearlessly addressed on the difficult terrain of religion. She considers her newest book, The Ghost of Eternal Polygamy, to be one of the most important works of her literary career and a vital move forward in the worldwide tide toward transforming patriarchy into partnership.

Amazingly, the definitive account of this seminal event has yet to be written. <br>The book offers the most complete account of what actually took place aboard Flight 93 &#x2013; from its delayed takeoff in Newark to the moment it plunged upside-down at 563 miles per hour into an open field in rural Somerset County, Pennsylvania. Flight 93 provides a riveting and complete narrative of the lead-up, event, and aftermath of the flight, based on interviews, oral histories, personal tours of the crash site and evidence recently made public. It examines the lead-up to that horrific morning; the stories of the victims who were launched into the center of history; the revolt that saved untold amounts of carnage on the ground and likely, the US Capitol; the eyewitnesses and first responders who rushed to the crash scene; the impact on family members; the effort to uncover evidence at the site; and the legacy the story leaves for future generations.Tom McMillan has spent a lifetime in media and communications: as a newspaper sports writer, radio talk-show host, and for the past 17 years as Vice President of Communications for the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League.

Wideman recalls the capture of his younger brother Robby, details the subsequent trials that resulted in a sentence of life in prison, and provides vivid views of the American prison system.<br>A gripping, unsettling account, Brothers and Keepers weighs the bonds of blood, tenderness, and guilt that connect Wideman to his brother and measures the distance that lies between them.</p><p>With novels like <i>Damballah</i> and <i>Hiding Place</i>, John Edgar Wideman began his career in an explicitly modernist vein--indeed, his chronicles of life in the Pittsburgh ghetto of Homewood had more than a trace of a Joycean accent. The autobiographical <i>Brothers and Keepers</i>, however, allowed the writer to find his own voice. Perhaps this dual portrait of the author and his brother Robby--serving, then and now, a life sentence for a murder committed during a bungled robbery--finally forced Wideman to fuse the modernist trappings of his earlier work with the storytelling traditions of African American culture. "My memories needed his," the author recalls. "Maybe the fact that we recall different things is crucial. Maybe they are foreground and background, propping each other up." In any case, the <i>Rashomon</i>-like result is a raw meditation on fate and family, as well as an indictment of our entire notion of crime and (especially) punishment.&#34;Like the Russian master [Dostoevsky], Wideman probes the torment of the soul....[He] is fashioning some of the most powerful literature today.&#34;--U.S. News and World Report</p><h2>Visual Basic in easy steps: Updated for Visual Basic 2019</h2><p><p><strong>Visual Basic in easy steps, 6th edition</strong> gives you code examples, screenshots, and step-by-step instructions that illustrate each aspect of Visual Basic so you'll be creating your own interactive applications in no time!. </p> <p>You need have no previous knowledge of any programming language so it's ideal if you're a newcomer to Windows programming.

Agents transform themselves in the process of, for example, becoming parents, embarking on careers, or acquiring a passion for music or politics. How can such activity be rational, if the reason for engaging in the relevant pursuit is only available to the person one will become? How is it psychologically possible to feel the attraction of a form of concern that is not yet one's own? How can the work done to arrive at the finish line be ascribed to one who doesn't (really) know what one is doing, or why one is doing it? In <em>Aspiration</em>, Agnes Callard asserts that these questions belong to the theory of aspiration. Aspirants are motivated by proleptic reasons, acknowledged defective versions of the reasons they expect to eventually grasp. The psychology of such a transformation is marked by intrinsic conflict between their old point of view on value and the one they are trying to acquire. They cannot adjudicate this conflict by deliberating or choosing or deciding-rather, they resolve it by working to see the world in a new way. This work has a teleological structure: by modeling oneself on the person he or she is trying to be, the aspirant brings that person into being. Because it is open to us to engage in an activity of self-creation, we are responsible for having become the kinds of people we are.<br></p><p><br><strong>Agnes Callard</strong> was born in Budapest, Hungary, raised in New York City and received a BA from the University of Chicago.

Students new to Athenian drama,readers of classical literature, and anyone wishing to kindle anew theirpassion for Greek tragedy will find no more captivating entrance to thesemilestones of world literature than in Bagg andScully&#x2019;s <em>The Complete Plays of Sophocles</em>.</p><p><p>The most celebrated plays of ancient Athens in vivid and dynamic newtranslations by award-winningpoets Robert Bagg and James Scully</p><p>The dominant Athenian playwright in fifth-century-BCE Athens, Sophocles left us seven powerful dramas that still shock as they render the violence that erupts within divinity and humankind. <em>Oedipus the King</em>, <em>Oedipus at Kolonos</em>, and <em>Antigone</em> trace three generations of a family manipulated by the inscrutably vindictive god Apollo to commit patricide, incest, and kin murder. <em>Elektra</em> and <em>Women of Trakhis</em> begin as studies of women obsessed with hatred and desire but become dissenting critiques of the Greeks&#x2019; enthusiasm for revenge and ego-crazed heroics. Two hard-hitting dramas set in war zones, <em>Aias</em> and <em>Philoktetes</em>, use conflicts among Greek warriors at Troy to thrash out political and ethical crises confronting Athenian society itself.</p><p>These translations, modern in idiom while faithful to the Greek and already proven stageworthy, preserve the depth and subtlety of Sophocles&#x2019; characters and refresh and clarify his narratives. Their focus on communities under extreme stress still resonates deeply for us here and now. This is Sophocles for a new generation entering the turbulent arena of ancient Greek drama.</p>Robert Bagg is the author of five books of poetry, including Madonna of the Cello, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.

If 'words are the building blocks for Christian theology,' as Don McKim insightfully notes in the preface, then we must make sure that the new generation of theologians are introduced both to growing tradition and ever-increasing diversity of approaches in contemporary theology; the number of new terms added in this revised edition helps reach that noble goal.

Planners make rapid decisions that have an immediate impact on the ground&#x2015;the width of streets, the minimum size of land parcels, the heights of buildings. The language they use to describe their objectives is qualitative&#x2015;&#x201c;sustainable,&#x201d; &#x201c;livable,&#x201d; &#x201c;resilient&#x201d;&#x2015;often with no link to measurable outcomes. Urban economics, on the other hand, is a quantitative science, based on theories, models, and empirical evidence largely developed in academic settings. In this book, the eminent urban planner Alain Bertaud argues that applying the theories of urban economics to the practice of urban planning would greatly improve both the productivity of cities and the welfare of urban citizens.</p><p>Bertaud explains that markets provide the indispensable mechanism for cities' development. He cites the experience of cities without markets for land or labor in pre-reform China and Russia; this &#x201c;urban planners' dream&#x201d; created inefficiencies and waste. Drawing on five decades of urban planning experience in forty cities around the world, Bertaud links cities' productivity to the size of their labor markets; argues that the design of infrastructure and markets can complement each other; examines the spatial distribution of land prices and densities; stresses the importance of mobility and affordability; and critiques the land use regulations in a number of cities that aim at redesigning existing cities instead of just trying to alleviate clear negative externalities. Bertaud concludes by describing the new role that joint teams of urban planners and economists could play to improve the way cities are managed.</p></p><p>Alain Bertaud is Senior Research Scholar at New York University&#39;s Marron Institute of Urban Management. He has worked as Principal Urban Planner for the World Bank and as an independent consultant and resident urban planner in cities ranging from Bangkok to New York.<p>Definitely recommended, this is now one of my favorite books on cities.</p>&#x2015;<i>Marginal Revolution</i><br><br><p><i>Order without Design </i>is a work with a clear vision for urban policy&#x2015;a magnum opus from one of the twenty-first century's great city planners. Similar to Jane Jacobs's <i>The Death and Life of the Great American City</i>, Bertaud's book manages to weave together theory and practice in a way that will be eye-opening to the curious urbanite and enriching to the practicing professional. If city planning has a future, its contours can almost certainly be found here.</p>&#x2015;<i>City Journal</i></p><h2>Because of the Messiah in a Manger</h2><p>Born on Christmas Day, Brad Wilcox has always had a special love for Christmas.

Edwards Deming is synonymous with the most insightful views, ideas, and commentary on management and quality control. Referred to as "the high prophet of quality" by the <i>New York Times</i>, Deming was instrumental in the spectacular rise of Japanese industry after World War II and influenced many of the world's most innovative managers in the ensuing decades. His original ideas led directly to the creation of relationships with suppliers and a plethora of quality initiatives.</p> <p>Now, with <i>The Essential Deming</i>, Fordham University professor and Deming expert Joyce Orsini draws on a wealth of previously unavailable material to present the legendary thinker's most important management principles in one indispensable volume.</p> <p>The book is filled with articles, papers, lectures, and notes touching on a wide range of topics, but which focus on Deming's overriding message: quality and operations are all about systems, not individual performance; the system has to be designed so that the worker can perform well.</p> <p><i>The Essential Deming</i> reveals Deming's unique insight about:</p><ul> <li>How poor management infects an entire organization </li><li>The critical importance of management on producing quality products and services </li><li>Improving management in any company </li><li>The effective management of people--the manager's single most important task </li><li>How to educate workers into critical thinkers </li><li>Ways to preserve statistical integrity while dealing with real-world problems</li></ul><p></p> <p>Fully authorized by the Deming estate and published in cooperation with The W.

Stillness Speaks takes the form of 200 individual entries, organized into 10 topic clusters.</p><p>Expanding on his mantra&#x2014;<i>Get out of your head and into the moment</i>&#x2014;Eckhart Tolle offers this new book on living in the now. Here Tolle emphasizes the art of "inner stillness"--the place where thoughts, ego and attachments fall always and we are left only with what the moment has to offer: "When you lose touch with inner stillness, you lose touch with yourself. When you lose touch with yourself, you lose yourself in the world." Don't expect this to be a quick skim or even a straight-through read. Like his previous bestselling book <i>The Power of Now</i>, Tolle uses brief entries and numerous white spaces to give readers easy in-and-out access into enticing spiritual insights that expound on inner stillness, such as learning the difference between surrender and resignation, overcoming the fear death, and how to end suffering. In fact, this is designed to be an ongoing conversation. Pick it up any time or any place, but be sure to allow for plenty of breaks for serious contemplation. Even as you occasionally abandon the book, don't abandon the teachings, pleads Tolle. Embracing and practicing inner stillness is no longer a luxury, he writes, "but a necessity if humankind is not to destroy itself. At the present time the dysfunction of the old consciousness and the arising of the new are both accelerating. Paradoxically things are getting worse and bett! er at the same time, although 'the worse' is more apparent because it makes so much noise." Devotees who have read all of Tolle's books and audio tapes probably won't find new ideas or information here. But they may appreciate the refresher course --revisiting familiar concepts in a slightly different package. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>Eckhart Tolle was born in Germany, where he spent the first thirteen years of his life. After graduating from the University of London, he was a research scholar and supervisor at Cambridge University. When he was twenty-nine, a profound spiritual transformation virtually dissolved his old identity and radically changed the course of his life. The next few years were devoted to understanding, integrating, and deepening that transformation, which marked the beginning of an intense inward journey. Eckhart is not aligned with any particular religion or tradition. In his teaching, he conveys a simple yet profound message with the timeless and uncomplicated clarity of the ancient spiritual masters: there is a way out of suffering and into peace. Eckhart is currently traveling extensively, taking his teachings and his presence throughout the world. He has lived in Vancouver, Canada, since 1996.</p><h2>As a Man Thinketh: Original 1902 Edition</h2><p><b>The Best Edition of As a Man Thinketh (Original Version) on Kindle <br><i>Beware of other editions with poor formatting and typos.</i><br><br>As we think, so we become.

Creating your ideal sanctuary involves hundreds of practical decisions from where to locate the shop and which machines and tools to buy to where to put the lights and electrical outlets.<br> <br> With the expert advice of professional woodworker and author Sandor Nagyszalanczy, you'll make the right choices to fit your space and budget. Detailed illustrations and useful tips help you handle every job, from insulating walls and organizing storage to installing dust collection. 'Shop Profiles' give you a look inside the shops of well-known woodworkers, so you can see how they've tackled common shop problems.<br> <br> With all the ingenious solutions in <strong><i>Setting Up Shop</i></strong>, you'll never run out of ideas for improving an existing shop or planning the shop of your dreams.</p></p><p><i>Setting Up Shop</i> is designed both for professional craftspeople who often have the poorest and most sparsely equipped shops because they are too busy to make improvements, and for hobbyists and weekend warriors who need a shop for entertainment as much getting work done. Author Sandor Nagyszalanczy does a good job of pointing out the relative benefits and drawbacks to various shop configurations and locations. In fact, one entire page is devoted to a chart comparing shops located in attics, basements, garages, or a spare room in the house, and how each rates for various factors, including noise, dust, headroom, access, structural limitations, heating, cooling, and moisture. This is a great how-to book with very useful topics in each chapter, including upgrading your electrical system; making sure you have the proper lighting, heating, and ventilation for your shop; picking the right tools and brands; deciding where to place machines and tools, benches and work areas; ensuring shop safety; methods for collecting dust; and more. <p> Each chapter is personalized with a visit to the shop of one craftsperson or another. The journey is made better by more than 240 color photos, as well as a healthy dose of black-and-white photos and line drawings. In the end, of course, the definition of a good or a smart shop is fluid, depending on its primary use and the need to change things from time to time. And both professional and hobbyist woodmakers can have as much pride in their shop as they do in a handmade chair. Nagyszalanczy has worked out of the same shop for nearly 20 years and admits that he takes offense when someone refers to it as a "garage." "You have to follow your heart as well as use your mind," Nagyszalanczy writes, "when transforming a simple building that others might call a shed or a garage into what you proudly call your woodshop." <i>--John Russell</i></p>Sandor Nagyszalanczy of Bonny Doon, California is a professional furniture designer and freelance writer, photographer and consultant.

Among her many awards are a Caldecott Medal, a Caldecott Honor, two Nebula Awards, two Christopher Medals, and the World Fantasy Award. She is also a poet and teacher of writing and literature.<br>Like Virginia Lee Burton's The Little House and the Provensens' Shaker Lane , this felicitous marriage of text and art portrays the impact of modernization on one community. Yolen's gently poetic text tells how the young Sally Jane witnesses the forming of the Quabbin Reservoir in western Massachusetts and, thereby, the unavoidable drowning of her Swift River valley town. Gradually the streets she traveled and the homes she played in are covered by water for the hungry city's (Boston's) needs. Since young readers caring about Sally Jane will see this plight through her eyes, they are sure to grasp the plot's historical relevance. But the author is telling more than a personal or even a regional story here. Sally Jane's mother's words at the book's end, recalled when the girl and her father are in a boat on the now-filled reservoir--"You have to let them go, Sally Jane"--speak wisely to all of us about our pasts. (These words touchingly echo the mother's earlier admonition regarding trapped fireflies.) Despite the somewhat uninspired jacket painting, Cooney's charmingly detailed, childlike and colorful art is the perfect choice for this New England tale. Children will be captivated by her perspective of earlier days, when kids played mumblety-pegsic and walked to school on scenic country roads. A stirring and resonant book.

With their never-ending loyalty, heroic deeds, comic behavior, and vibrant personalities, pets are companions but can also be our closest friends and dearest confidants. The death of a pet is always heart wrenching and tragic. Legendary psychic Sylvia Browne provides comfort for those grieving over the loss of a beloved animal by showing how pets continue to be with us even after their deaths. <br> <br> Sylvia uses forty years of research and decades' worth of true stories culled from readings and her own experiences to show how our pets have unique personalities, quirks, and habits that make up their spirit and soul. Sharing heartwarming stories from pets on both sides of life, Sylvia Browne examines how our animals live in the afterlife, whether we will see them on the Other Side, how their presence affects us daily, and where animals fit into the whole of Creation. <br> <br> In <i>All Pets Go to Heaven</i>, Sylvia Browne explains how pets, like humans, have a spirit that travels to the Other Side.</p><p>Sylvia Browne grew up in Kansas City, Missouri and revealed her psychic gift at the age of three, announcing that her grandfather was dead (he was) and predicting she would have a baby sister in three years (she did). Browne began her professional career in 1973 with a small meeting in her home. Within a year Browne&#x2019;s practice had grown so much that she incorporated the business as the Nirvana Foundation for Psychic Research.<br> <br> Browne was a true professional: she maintained required business licenses, was a member of a national consumer protection agency, and donated a large portion of her time to charitable organizations and also worked with police to investigate missing persons and other criminal cases. She consulted with police and FBI on several high-profile cases, including the disappearance of Chandra Levy and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. She was the president of her business, now known as the Sylvia Browne Corporation, Browne also founded her own church, the Society of Novus Spirit. Her most recent business venture was The Sylvia Browne Hypnosis Training Center, where her unique, proven hypnosis methods for personal and professional use are taught.<br> <br> With&nbsp;twenty-two <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers, Browne was an accomplished author of more than 46 books. She appeared regularly on the <i>Montel Williams Show </i>for&nbsp;seventeen years, and was a&nbsp;frequent&nbsp;guest on&nbsp;<i>Larry King Live</i>,&nbsp;traveled the country at&nbsp;sold-out lectures,&nbsp;and regularly appeared in the print media. She lived and practiced in California, where she passed in 2013.All Pets Go To Heaven <br> <br> 1<p></p> ANIMALS IN OUR LIVES<p></p> <br> <br>&#x201c;We will be known forever by the tracks we leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Dakota Indian proverb<br><br>For my entire career as a professional psychic, people have come to me asking questions about everything in their lives&#x2014;their jobs, their families, their relationships, and their futures. But one question comes up time and again: What happens to my beloved pet when he dies? People want to be assured that their dog or cat or bird or horse&#x2014;creatures they love just as much as any human in their life&#x2014;will find peace in the afterlife.<br> <br>I am here to tell you that all pets do go to heaven. I will also explain to you the extraordinary abilities that pets have here on earth that we&#x2019;re just beginning to understand and acknowledge. These abilities lead us to amazing stories of the bonds between humans and the animals they love, experiences with animals both in this world and on the Other Side, which reaffirm the remarkable relationships we have with our precious pets.<br> <br>Since before recorded history, humankind has always had a relationship with animals, whether it was for sustenance, protection, worship, or to give service. Gradually over time many of the animals encountered by humans were domesticated and formed either a loving partnership with us as pets or were put into service to help humankind in its work or as a food source. We even see when animals are taken to visit the elderly how that person&#x2019;s blood pressure goes down and any depression subsides. I&#x2019;m convinced animals can neutralize negative energy without ever absorbing it as we do. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve even referred to them as a form of guardian angel on this planet.<br> <br>The stories that follow will show the different facets of what animals do and can do and how sentient they are. Whether it&#x2019;s just your dear pet and protectorate or your own totem (which we will get to later), we will see how animals have saved lives and even see and feel things that we cannot see or feel such as seeing spirits or alerting us to fire or even earthquakes long before we are aware of such things. Humankind has just begun to scratch the surface of the great intelligence our animals have, and hopefully you will get a deeper insight into the sometimes complex minds of our beloved friends in the animal kingdom. This book will explore through research as well as personal stories the help, bravery, love, and loyalty these wondrous creatures afford us.<br><br>They are not dead who live in the hearts they leave behind.<br> <br>&#x2014;TUSCARORA<br> <br> <br>WHEN WE LOSE A PET<br> <br>Most animal lovers have a pet, and those pets quickly become a part of their families. When a beloved pet passes away, a huge void is left in your family, not to mention your heart. It makes me furious when someone is grieving over the loss of a pet and they hear the words, &#x201c;Well, after all it was only an animal!&#x201d; When these words have been uttered to me, rather than froth at the mouth I usually try to simply walk away. As I&#x2019;ve grown older I&#x2019;ve tried to be more tolerant and say to myself that these people just don&#x2019;t know; they are simply ignorant of the love and richness that our pets lend to our lives.<br> <br>We will expand on the subject of pet loss later, but right now I want to tell you about my Jolie. Jolie was a West Highland terrier and the most active, funny, and caring dog I have ever known. She was one of my dearest pets, and I had her for nine wonderful years. One day I got a call at work that Jolie had suddenly keeled over and was nonresponsive. My youngest, psychic son, Chris, ran over and gave her some resuscitation by pushing on her rib cage, and by the time I got home she was sitting up, but with a glazed look on her face. I immediately noticed she was terribly bloated, and we raced her to the vet. After a whole battery of tests he told me grimly that the news wasn&#x2019;t good. Jolie was suffering from severe heart failure. He explained that the symptoms are similar to those experienced by people who have heart attacks or strokes. Jolie, he said, was filling up with water so fast she would drown in her own fluid. I had to put her to sleep. He suggested that I leave the room, but I wouldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;I wanted my eyes to be the last thing Jolie saw.<br> <br>The shot was administered, and I truly felt like she was saying, it&#x2019;s okay Mom, I&#x2019;ll see you again and I love you. &#x201c;I love you Jolie,&#x201d; I sobbed. &#x201c;Wait for me.&#x201d; I knew she would because animals don&#x2019;t reincarnate&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t have to. They don&#x2019;t need to learn lessons of life like we do. They are just pure entities sent from God. I watched a white and condensed smokelike form leave her body and go straight across the room. The souls of animals don&#x2019;t have to go up because heaven (or the Other Side) is on this level, just in another dimension, with the same topography we have here except for the beautiful gardens, meadows, and temples. (We&#x2019;ll talk more about the Other Side later in this book.) In my psychic vision I could see Jolie romping through a garden of daffodils and playing and meeting my other dogs that had gone before. This gave me some small comfort, but as with all grief I felt cheated. I was glad she was happy, but selfishly I wanted her with me. Still, I knew she was happy, and I knew I&#x2019;d see her again someday.<br><br>Our first teacher is our own heart.<br> <br>&#x2014;CHEYENNE<br><br>The hole our animals leave when they go is immeasurable, and even though life goes on (just as it does when any loved one leaves you), so many things remind you of them. No one meeting you at the door...the toys that are still around...even the empty food dishes seem like stark reminders of your missing friend. After Jolie passed, I just preferred to leave everything the way it was for awhile because honestly, I couldn&#x2019;t stand to get rid of the last vestiges of her. Yes, I did feel her around jumping on the bed and brushing against my leg, and several times I actually saw a little white blur in the backyard that I knew was my Jolie. But this loss hit me particularly hard, and I truly felt like just going to bed.<br> <br>You don&#x2019;t, of course. You get up, you keep living your life, and when time goes by other dogs or pets take the place of your beloved pet. But no matter how much time goes by, that animal will always have a special place in your heart. Later on I&#x2019;ll share more of my own stories of pet love and loss, and you&#x2019;ll also read the remarkable stories of other people who have wondrous tales about their beloved pets, some poignant and sad, some inspiring in their bravery and protection, still others amazing tales of communication and love, but all of them truly moving and wondrous.<br> <br>WHEN OUR PETS PERFORM EXTRAORDINARY ACTS<br> <br>Presently I have four dogs, but when I was younger I had cats. Both types of animals have their own distinct personalities and I love each of them in their own special way. I have had so many dogs in my seventy-two years of life that it&#x2019;s hard to even remember all of the breeds&#x2014;German shepherds, dachshunds, West Highland terriers, Rhodesian Ridgebacks, Great Danes, Lhasa Apsos, Shar-Peis, Labradoodles, golden retrievers, Bijon Frises, Shih Tzus, English bulldogs, Labradors, Yorkshire terriers, not to mention a number of beloved mutts of mixed breeding&#x2014;each one holding a special place in my heart, and each one with a distinct personality of their own. I still have some of my beloved dogs, but over the years I have lost many pets that were dear to me. The truth is, many times I&#x2019;ve loved my animals more than some people in my life! An animal&#x2019;s loyalty is unfaltering, and a pet doesn&#x2019;t care how you look or what mood you&#x2019;re in; they just love you unconditionally, which we could all really learn from!<br> <br>My dear grandmother (who was a psychic in her own right and very well known in Kansas City, Missouri) used to say if you find someone who doesn&#x2019;t like animals, children, or music...run. Over all the years I have found this to be usually true, especially with those who don&#x2019;t like animals.<br> <br>One amazing story my grandmother told me was an event her family witnessed secondhand, a tale that was told for years in their small community. My grandmother was born in Germany, but her family had made its way to the United States when she was very young, first to Texas and then to Springfield, Missouri, where the winters were horrendous. When I was a girl in that part of the world, we were literally snowbound for days at a time by the ferocity of winter storms (not anything like the milder winters experienced in that part of the world today, which as an aside supports the Greenhouse Theory!).<br> <br>There was a family that lived next door to my grandmother&#x2019;s family, and they stepped out just a short distance away from home to get supplies one cold winter day and left their sleeping baby with their German shepherd, who really was like a watchful nanny to the baby. They intended to be gone just a few minutes, but while they were gone a sudden terrible snowstorm hit. It was the type of storm we used to call a whiteout&#x2014;you literally couldn&#x2019;t see your hand in front of your face. After many hours the family finally made their way back to their house, and when they walked in, the baby&#x2019;s crib was empty. The house was freezing cold because the heat had dissipated in their absence. The German shepherd was cringing and whimpering under the bed. The husband in fear and dread deduced (as did the wife) that the dog had harmed the baby out of hunger or even fear of abandonment. The husband, out of his mind with grief, got his rifle and aimed it at the dog&#x2019;s head. Just as he cocked it to shoot they heard a faint cry. They looked under the bed and there was the baby cuddled up to the dog to keep it warm. The dog, realizing the peril of the baby possibly freezing to death, had lifted the baby and put it under the bed, wrapping its warm body around the child to keep it from freezing. My grandmother said the woman never quit talking about how horrible it would have been if they had killed the dog that saved their baby from freezing.<br> <br>Now I know we can say the parents of the child were neglectful in leaving their baby in the care of their dog, but times then were different and much harder, and the sudden storm caught them unaware. But all that aside, consider the logical reasoning of this marvelous animal being. This wonderful dog knew, either instinctively or spiritually, how to save a human being, realizing that if it were left in the freezing air the baby would have died.<br> <br><br> <br>That&#x2019;s why I know that dogs and other creatures are not just &#x201c;dumb animals.&#x201d; They do think, feel, and sense. But are they directed by a &#x201c;higher power&#x201d; as some would say? I believe that, in the same way that our choices can be &#x201c;directed&#x201d; or influenced by God to help someone or save someone, so too can animals&#x2019; behaviors be aimed toward good. We all are vessels of information infused from God, if we just listen, but an animal&#x2019;s brain doesn&#x2019;t have all the complexities that our mind does. Animals are just pure, uncomplicated entities of creation from God. They live like the Maasai do in Kenya&#x2014;for each day is forever to them and the &#x201c;Now&#x201d; is what they live in. You can get aggravated with your pets and yell at them, but in a matter of minutes they are licking your hand again in love. Animals have no thoughts of vengeance and don&#x2019;t carry grudges; they are just simply loyal and loving creatures.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t think many people realize how sentient animals are. They can detect illness, for example. My friend had a black Labrador retriever, and every time he came up to her he literally would put his nose in her right eye and try to lick it. I watched this a few times and then I said, &#x201c;Susan, just for the hell of it why don&#x2019;t you get an MRI, because that is not normal behavior.&#x201d; She finally did, and her doctor found a tumor just behind her right eye. Thankfully, the growth was caught in time, but the doctor said it could have spread and might have been very serious. Doctors are now finding that many dogs can not only smell drugs but can actually sniff out illness, especially tumors and cancer.<br> <br>I have been privy to many such stories, and throughout this book I&#x2019;ll also tell you tales of animals who have gone to great lengths to protect and help the people they love&#x2014;stories that are all part of our lives with these very spiritual beings we call our pets.<br> <br>TAKING CARE OF THE ANIMALS WE LOVE<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no doubt that our animals are good to us; but sometimes we need to be reminded about how to treat them. Dr. Donald Coggans, who was the former Archbishop of Canterbury said: &#x201c;Animals as part of God&#x2019;s Creation have rights which must be respected. It behooves us always to be sensitive to their needs and the reality of their pain.&#x201d; The famous Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras stated: &#x201c;As long as man continues to be a ruthless destroyer of lower living beings he will never know health or peace. For as long as man does needless massacre of animals they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seeds of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love.&#x201d; According to the Bible, man has been given dominion over all living things. I believe in the end humankind will live to regret their abusive actions not only to animals but this planet we live on. It&#x2019;s interesting to note that every major religion puts forth in some way that animals should be loved and protected, yet we as animal lovers are still appalled by the cruelty that is heaped on them.<br> <br>Animals never create wars, and wild animals only kill to survive. Wild animals, in particular, don&#x2019;t know avarice or vengeance, and even the ones that I have seen that seemed to go &#x201c;mad&#x201d; are usually influenced by some other forces, usually because man has either encroached on their territory or treated them in a brutal manner. It&#x2019;s not that they are vengeful in any way; they just want to survive and protect their young and territory. How many times have you seen on a nature program the disastrous effects of humankind&#x2019;s encroachment on the habitats of wild animals? The animals are only responding in a natural manner for their own survival. If we take away their natural prey due to our expansion on the land, then they in turn have to survive and begin to prey on domesticated animals or search for food in areas inhabited by man, which, of course, means that they will be hunted and killed because they are considered a danger or nuisance. They are only trying to survive, but humankind, as it always has, will continue to kill and expand and exterminate species after species.<br> <br>Finally, in this book, we&#x2019;ll look at ways we can protect the animals we love&#x2014;both those we keep as pets and the majestic beasts in the wild&#x2014;and how we can each act as a steward and friend to the creatures we love most.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>Some people may find it offensive when I say I prefer my pets to some people I&#x2019;ve met&#x2014;the truth is, they are more loving, loyal, compassionate, and, yes, even smarter in some instances! But as I always say in all my writings&#x2014;take with you what you want and leave the rest. One fact I&#x2019;m sure of is that God created animals not just to feed and clothe us but to be our loving companions in life that comfort, protect, and warn us, as well as understand more than we ever think they do.<br> <br>Whether you are a pet owner or not, animals do affect your life&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just that with pet owners, animals affect our lives in a much greater sense than those who don&#x2019;t own pets. Not only do animals help to clothe and feed us, but depending upon the pet and the family, our relationship w...</p><h2>The Mystery Cruise (29) (The Boxcar Children Mysteries)</h2><p>Someone is trying to keep Max Greene from inheriting his great aunt&#39;s estate.</p><p>Gertrude Chandler Warner was born in 1890 in Putnam, Connecticut, where she taught school and wrote The Boxcar Children because she had often imagined how delightful it would be to live in a caboose or freight car.

The aim is to create systems that enable every student, faculty, and staff member to thrive and achieve to maximum potential within a diversity framework. <br> <br>This book is written from the perspective that diversity work is best approached as an intellectual endeavor with a pragmatic focus on achieving results that takes an evidence-based approach to operationalizing diversity. <br><br>It offers an overarching conceptual framework for pursuing diversity in a national and international context; delineates and describes the competencies, knowledge and skills needed to take effective leadership in matters of diversity; offers new data about related practices in higher education; and presents and evaluates a range of strategies, organizational structures and models drawn from institutions of all types and sizes. It covers such issues as the reorganization of the existing diversity infrastructure, building accountability systems, assessing the diversity process, and addressing legal threats to implementation. Its purpose is to help strategic diversity leaders combine big-picture thinking with an on-the-ground understanding of organizational reality and work strategically with key stakeholders and allies. <br> <br>This book is intended for presidents, provosts, chief diversity officers or diversity professionals, and anyone who wants to champion diversity and embed its objectives on his or her campus, whether at the level of senior administration, as members of campus organizations or committees, or as faculty, student affairs professionals or students taking a leadership role in making and studying the process of change.<br><br>This title is also available in a set with its companion volume, <b><i>The Chief Diversity Officer</i></b><i>.</i></p><p>Damon A.

Bluegills dart out to feed on insects; a dragonfly snaps up mosquitoes, and then is snapped up himself by a tree swallow. At midmorning, five mallard ducklings narrowly escape the powerful jaws of a snapping turtle; a woodchuck also has luck on his side, when he scampers into his burrow just ahead of a marsh hawk. Sunset finds a largemouth bass on the end of a hook as a young boy reels him in from his canoe. Nighttime is the busiest of all; bats and nighthawks feast on bugs, crayfish search for night crawlers, and raccoons look for crayfish. Two concepts are beautifully demonstrated in this picture book for older readers: the hunter invariably becomes the hunted, and all living things are players in a complex cycle of interdependence that is much more than a simple food chain. Heinz fills this nature drama with action and sensory-loaded language that pulls children in as no science textbook can, and Marstall's realistic watercolor illustrations offer a lovely window to observe the diverse ecosystem. An excellent resource for the science curriculum. <i>Lauren Peterson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

When Cooper, Hiro, and Gordy witness the robbery and beating of a beloved diner owner, they flee the scene, Cooper with the diner's video surveillance in hand. One of the masked men sees him and orders him to surrender the hard drive containing footage of the holdup. In fear, Cooper begs his friends to keep quiet about the robbery. He is sure dirty cops are involved, while Hiro (a dead cop's daughter and a bit of a detective-in-training) suspects a local bully and his father. The trio is in a race to uncover the criminals before cagey Detective Hammer interrogates the entire eighth-grade class and fingers them as witnesses, putting them all at risk. Cooper is an adept liar who manages to evade the criminals and the police. Hiro, the group's conscience, struggles to remain silent, and Gordy just wants things to return to normal. Afraid to contact police, these three teens attempt to discover the criminals themselves at great personal risk. Suspenseful and with a heart-pounding conclusion, this crime drama is a great recommendation for fans of mysteries and thrillers.-Kimberly Garnick Giarratano, Rockaway Township Public Library, NJ&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

In my 45+ years of researching this phenomenon, I&#x2019;ve heard several very strange reports. A few of these reports, from seemingly heartfelt people, claimed that these creatures disappeared. Is that even possible? Can the laws of quantum physics actually answer that question? Knowing what I know, I&#x2019;m compelled to delve in and see. The accepted mathematics of quantum physics says that there is more going on than what we see with our three-dimensional eyes. Scientists now know, through physics, that empty space (Dark Matter, Dark Energy) is not actually empty...however, it is a dimension existing outside of the human light spectrum and the observable vibrational frequency. It seems to me that classical science has restricted itself by its own disciplines and because of those disciplines, will never grasp the big picture. If we use the classical box to try and determine all that exists, we would never begin to understand the cosmos, e.g., the world of spirituality. The math of quantum physics indicates that there are at least eleven dimensions in existence...possibly innumerable. So, could the laws of quantum physics be the answer to the Bigfoot mysteries?</p><p></p><h2>Teaching and Learning STEM: A Practical Guide</h2><p><p><b>Rethink traditional teaching methods to improve student learning and retention in STEM</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Educational research has repeatedly shown that compared to traditional teacher-centered instruction, certain learner-centered methods lead to improved learning outcomes, greater development of critical high-level skills, and increased retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.</p> <p><i>Teaching and Learning STEM</i>&nbsp;presents a trove of practical research-based strategies for designing and teaching STEM courses at the university, community college, and high school levels.

Only a small group had gathered on that warm and buggy June day to mourn the passing of Montague Saul, no more than a dozen people, many of whom the boy had just met. For the past six months, he had been away at boarding school, and today he was seeing some of these people for the very first time. Most of them did not interest him in the least.<br><br> But his uncle&#x2019;s family&#x2014;they interested him very much. They were worth studying.<br><br> Dr. Peter Saul looked very much like his dead brother Montague, slender and cerebral in owlish glasses, brown hair thinning toward inevitable baldness. His wife, Amy, had a round, sweet face, and she kept darting anxious looks at her fifteen-year-old nephew, as though aching to wrap her arms around him and smother him with a hug. Their son, Teddy, was ten years old, all skinny arms and legs. A little clone of Peter Saul, right down to the same owlish glasses.<br><br> Finally, there was the daughter, Lily. Sixteen years old.<br><br> Tendrils of her hair had come loose from the ponytail and now clung to her face in the heat. She looked uncomfortable in her black dress, and she kept shifting coltishly back and forth, as though preparing to bolt. As though she&#x2019;d rather be anywhere than in this cemetery, waving away buzzing insects.<br><br> They look so normal, so average, the boy thought. So different from me. Then Lily&#x2019;s gaze suddenly met his, and he felt a tremor of surprise. Of mutual recognition. In that instant, he could almost feel her gaze penetrating the darkest fissures of his brain, examining all the secret places that no one else had ever seen. That he&#x2019;d never allowed them to see.<br><br> Disquieted, he looked away. Focused, instead, on the other people standing around the grave: His father&#x2019;s housekeeper. The attorney. The two next-door neighbors. Mere acquaintances who were here out of a sense of propriety, not affection. They knew Montague Saul only as the quiet scholar who&#x2019;d recently returned from Cyprus, who spent his days fussing over books and maps and little pieces of pottery. They did not really know the man. Just as they did not really know his son.<br><br> At last the service ended, and the gathering moved toward the boy, like an amoeba preparing to engulf him in sympathy, to tell him how sorry they were that he&#x2019;d lost his father. And so soon after moving to the United States.<br><br> &#x201c;At least you have family here to help you,&#x201d; said the minister.<br><br> Family? Yes, I suppose these people are my family, the boy thought, as little Teddy shyly approached, urged forward by his mother.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be my brother now,&#x201d; said Teddy.<br><br> &#x201c;Am I?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Mom has your room all ready for you. It&#x2019;s right next to mine.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m staying here. In my father&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;<br><br> Bewildered, Teddy looked at his mother. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he coming home with us?&#x201d;<br><br> Amy Saul quickly said, &#x201c;You really can&#x2019;t live all by yourself, dear. You&#x2019;re only fifteen. Maybe you&#x2019;ll like it so much in Purity, you&#x2019; ll want to stay with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;My school&#x2019;s in Connecticut.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, but the school year&#x2019;s over now. In September, if you want to return to your boarding school, of course you can. But for the summer, you&#x2019;ll come home with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I won&#x2019; t be alone here. My mother will come for me.&#x201d;<br><br> There was a long silence. Amy and Peter looked at each other, and the boy could guess what they were thinking. His mother abandoned him ages ago.<br><br> &#x201c;She is coming for me,&#x201d; he insisted.<br><br> Uncle Peter said, gently, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll talk about it later, son.&#x201d;<br><br> In the night, the boy laid awake in his bed, in his father&#x2019;s town house, listening to the voices of his aunt and uncle murmuring downstairs in the study. The same study where Montague Saul had labored these past months to translate his fragile little scraps of papyrus. The same study where, five days ago, he&#x2019;d had a stroke and collapsed at his desk. Those people should not be in there, among his father&#x2019;s precious things. They were invaders in his house.<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s still just a boy, Peter. He needs a family.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t exactly drag him back to Purity if he doesn&#x2019;t want to come with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re only fifteen, you have no choice in the matter. Adults have to make the decisions.&#x201d;<br><br> The boy rose from bed and slipped out of his room. He crept halfway down the stairs to listen in to the conversation.<br><br> &#x201c;And really, how many adults has he known? Your brother didn&#x2019;t exactly qualify. He was so wrapped up in his old mummy linens, he probably never noticed there was a child underfoot.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not fair, Amy. My brother was a good man.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good, but clueless. I can&#x2019;t imagine what kind of woman would dream of having a child with him. And then she leaves the boy behind for Monty to raise? I don&#x2019; t understand any woman who&#x2019;d do that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Monty didn&#x2019;t do such a bad job raising him. The boy&#x2019;s getting top marks in school.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your measurement for what makes a good father? The fact that the boy gets top marks?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s also a poised young man. Look how well he held up at the service.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s numb, Peter. Did you see a single emotion on his face today?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Monty was like that, too.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Cold-blooded, you mean?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, intellectual. Logical.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But underneath it all, you know that boy has got to be hurting. It makes me want to cry, how much he needs his mother right now. How he keeps insisting she&#x2019;ll come back for him, when we know she won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve never even met the woman! Monty just writes us from Cairo one day, to tell us he has a brand-new son. For all we know, he plucked him up from the reeds, like baby Moses.&#x201d;<br><br> The boy heard the floor creak above him, and he glanced toward the top of the stairs. He was startled to see his cousin Lily staring down at him over the banister. She was watching him, studying him, as if he were some exotic creature she&#x2019;d never before encountered and she was trying to decide if he was dangerous.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; said Aunt Amy. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re up!&#x201d;<br><br> His aunt and uncle had just come out of the study, and they were standing at the bottom of the stairs, looking up at him. Looking a little dismayed, too, at the possibility that he had overheard their entire conversation.<br><br> &#x201c;Are you feeling all right, dear?&#x201d; said Amy.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, Auntie.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so late. Maybe you should go back to bed now?&#x201d;<br><br> But he didn&#x2019;t move. He paused on the stairs for a moment, wondering what it would be like to live with these people. What he might learn from them. It would make the summer interesting, until his mother came for him.<br><br> He said, &#x201c;Aunt Amy, I&#x2019;ve made up my mind.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;About what?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;About my summer, and where I&#x2019;d like to spend it.&#x201d;<br><br> She instantly assumed the worst. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t be too hasty! We have a really nice house, right on the lake, and you&#x2019;d have your own room. At least come for a visit before you decide.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve decided to come stay with you.&#x201d;<br><br> His aunt paused, temporarily stunned. Then her face lit up in a smile, and she hurried up the steps to give him a hug. She smelled like Dove soap and Breck shampoo. So average, so ordinary. Then a grinning Uncle Peter gave him an affectionate clap on the shoulder, his way of welcoming a new son. Their happiness was like a web of spun sugar, drawing him into their universe, where all was love and light and laughter.<br><br> &#x201c;The kids will be so glad you&#x2019;re coming back with us!&#x201d; said Amy.<br><br> He glanced toward the top of the stairs, but Lily was no longer there. She had slipped away, unnoticed. I will have to keep my eye on her, he thought. Because already, she&#x2019;s keeping her eye on me.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re part of our family now,&#x201d; said Amy.<br><br> As they walked up the stairs together, she was already telling him her plans for the summer. All the places they&#x2019;d take him, all the special meals they&#x2019;d cook for him when they got back home. She sounded happy, even giddy, like a mother with her brand-new baby.<br><br> Amy Saul had no idea what they were about to bring home with them.</p><h2>The Active Learning Classroom: Strategies for Practical Educators</h2><p>The goal of the book is simple: To improve student achievement by helping teachers implement active learning strategies in the classroom. To begin, consider the following two questions in relation to your own classroom: 1. Are your students actively engaged throughout the entirety of your daily lessons? 2. Are students meeting your highest expectations regarding achievement? If you answered &#x2018;no&#x2019; to either or both of these questions, you are not alone. Classroom teachers at all levels are challenged with low student engagement, resulting in low student achievement. Numerous studies indicate a positive correlation between engagement and achievement. For this reason, the teacher is the most important component of the learning process, as he/she is ultimately responsible for creating an atmosphere conducive to student achievement. Active Learning has proven to be one of the most important tools for engaging students, promoting skills in motivation, higher-order thinking, communication, creative thinking, and problem-solving. Most teachers agree that these skills are essential for increasing student achievement; however, these skills are difficult to foster in the traditional &#x2018;sage on a stage&#x2019; model. Educators must learn to adopt a new &#x2018;guide on the side&#x2019; teaching paradigm whereby traditional instruction is supplemented by active learning strategies.</p><p></p><h2>Scottish Rite Masonry Vol.2</h2><p><p>This Second Volume is simply a continuation of the first one.

The ride to NBC&#x2019;s Burbank Studios, according to the public relations people handling my tour, would take at least fifty minutes in the late-afternoon traffic.<br> &nbsp;<br> This was the big one, a perfect climax to three weeks of newspaper interviews, personal appearances on radio and television talk shows, and autograph parties in bookstores from coast to coast. If only I had known how big this night was going to rank in my life, I might have remained in my room at the Century Plaza, double-locked the door, and watched television in my pajamas.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ever been on the Carson show before, Mr. Lawrence?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I shook my head at the inquisitive brown eyes squinting back at me from the distant rearview mirror. Although I was heading for my sixty-first media appearance in twenty days, I felt tense for the first time. I had already managed to conduct myself on the Donahue show with some measure of aplomb, visited with Merv, joked with Snyder, and even held hands with Dinah. So why the butterflies now? I closed my eyes and tried to relax, hoping the Tanner limo people had sent a chauffeur who was not a talker. No such luck.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve read a lot of your books, Mr. Lawrence. Ter-r-r-r-ific! My wife and I, we both love &#x2019;em.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re very kind,&#x201d; I replied, before I could stop myself. Reflex action. A simple phrase used repeatedly by many authors to acknowledge the heady and often embarrassing praise heaped on them by their fans. I had never realized how banal those words sounded until I shared an autograph session with Erma Bombeck and we caught each other mouthing the same response as we signed our weary signatures. Erma thought it was hilarious, but we both decided to be more creative in the humility department from then on.<br> &nbsp;<br> My driver skillfully eased his glistening chariot out of the hotel&#x2019;s Mercedes-cluttered circular driveway and onto the Avenue of the Stars. &#x201c;You must be some kind of smar-r-rt man, Mr. Lawrence, yessir! A genius! Don&#x2019;t know how you think up all those impossible crimes and then put all the pieces together. Never have been able to figure out who the murderer is until the very last pages. Never! Your stuff is even better than those old Sherlock Holmes things&#x2014;yessir!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I tilted my head back and closed my eyes again, taking care not to cross my legs and wrinkle the Calvin Klein brown tweed that my wife, Kitty, had insisted I wear for the &#x201c;Tonight Show.&#x201d; Sherlock Holmes, did the man say? As we glided on our radial cushions toward Burbank, I tried to keep my mind off the show by recalling all the masters of mystery fiction I had been compared with during the tour. Rex Stout and Agatha Christie had been mentioned often, as well as my favorite, S. S. Van Dine. John Dickson Carr&#x2019;s name had also come up frequently, and Ellery Queen had been suggested by a Chicago Sun- Times reporter who didn&#x2019;t know that two cousins, Manfred B. Lee and Frederic Dannay, had written under the Queen pseudonym and that Mr. Lee had now gone on to that great inner sanctum in the sky. One intense young woman from Writer&#x2019;s Digest had even compared what she gushingly called the &#x201c;vivid realism&#x201d; of my writing to France&#x2019;s best, Georges Simenon. The temptation had been strong to tell her that she was being &#x201c;very kind,&#x201d; but I resisted. Everyone enjoys a little flattery, even when they know it&#x2019;s not true.<br> &nbsp;<br> With all twenty-six of my detective novels still available in paperback and selling as well as when they were first published, both Kitty and my publishers had argued against my going on tour. She had insisted that it was an unnecessary intrusion on my time and energy and they agreed, maintaining that every Matt Lawrence book always made the best-seller lists anyway. Still, I prevailed. I had never been on an author&#x2019;s promotional merry-go-round before, and I thought the experience would be a good change of pace. It might even supply me with some fresh story material.<br> &nbsp;<br> Looking back, I had enjoyed every silly day and night of it, as Elia Kazan had said I would. I had no idea whether my appearances had helped or hurt the sales of my latest effort, Where Weep the Silver Willows, but now that it was ending for me, after Carson, I almost regretted having to return to the quiet serenity of our Camelback Mountain home, high above the city of Phoenix.<br> &nbsp;<br> Exactly forty-eight minutes after I entered the limousine it turned off West Alameda into a forest of high wire fencing, paused at an inner gate long enough for the guard to recognize my driver, and then eased alongside an unmarked door. I thanked my enthusiastic fan behind the steering wheel and went in, immediately recognizing the small, anxious blonde from my publisher&#x2019;s public relations firm. She had almost given me a coronary yesterday morning, by expertly demonstrating the high-speed cornering ability of her Porsche 924 after we had fallen behind schedule for a taped interview in the posh patio coffee shop at the Beverly Hills Hotel.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hi, Mary&#x2014;or should I start calling you Mario?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She ignored my weak attempt at humor. &#x201c;Oh, Mr. Lawrence, we were beginning to worry. Gee, you look great! Just like that handsome hunk in the Wind Song perfume commercials!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, young lady, never having seen those commercials, I don&#x2019;t know whether I&#x2019;m being complimented or placed in a category that I doubt would appeal to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She ignored my weak attempt at humor. &#x201c;Oh, Mr. Lawrence, we were beginning to worry. Gee, you look great! Just like that handsome hunk in the Wind Song perfume commercials!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, young lady, never having seen those commercials, I don&#x2019;t know whether I&#x2019;m being complimented or placed in a category that I doubt would appeal to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She tossed her head saucily and laughed. &#x201c;Oh, yes you do! Follow me. I&#x2019;ll take you to the famous green room. The other guests are all there, I think. Taping will begin in about thirty minutes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Inside the green room&#x2014;that isn&#x2019;t green&#x2014;Mary introduced me to a young man on Johnny Carson&#x2019;s staff whose name was Alfred. Then she kissed me lightly on the cheek, wished me luck, and was gone. Alfred asked if I would like to meet the other guests on the show, and I said I would. First I shook hands with Charles Nelson Reilly, comedian and director. Reilly admitted to having been a Lawrence fan for years and proved it by rattling off at least a dozen titles of mine. I responded by complimenting him for his sensitive direction of the Julie Harris tour de force portraying Emily Dickinson&#x2019;s troubled life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Next, Jimmy Stewart, looking bigger than life, came over and introduced himself. We found our common ground quickly, having both served in the Eighth Air Force during World War II. Finally, I shook hands with a ravishing brunette singer, Donna Theodore, who reminded me very much of our old squadron&#x2019;s favorite pin-up girl, Jane Russell.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eventually the friends of the guests were courteously asked to leave, and the four of us were left to uplift each other&#x2019;s waning courage. We failed miserably. There&#x2019;s something so mind-boggling, even to show-biz personalities, in knowing that what you say and do will be shown to fifteen million people that only a lunatic or a complete fool would not feel inhibited. Except for a few throwaway remarks about the ubiquitous smog and California&#x2019;s Jerry Brown, little was said by any of us until we heard Ed McMahon exclaim, &#x201c;He-e-e-re&#x2019;s Johnny!&#x201d; and everyone gratefully directed their undivided attention toward the huge RCA television set.<br> &nbsp;<br> Johnny&#x2019;s monologue chided the Los Angeles Dodgers for their long losing streak, needled the current Congress for its inability to pass any legislation except another raise for its members, and unloaded on used-car dealers whose opinion of their own sales abilities is so inflated that they insist on appearing in their own obnoxious television commercials with props ranging from boa constrictors to Dolly Parton look-alikes. Charles Nelson Reilly almost made me forget my nervousness when he described his run-in with a coast guard cutter while desperately trying to bring a runaway engine on his small boat under control. Then Jimmy Stewart showed film clips of a forthcoming special he was hosting, on another network, dealing with unidentified flying objects, and Donna Theodore belted out two rock hits that seemed completely implausible, to me, coming from such a regal and lovely woman.<br> &nbsp;<br> Alfred startled me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in luck, Mr. Lawrence!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh? How is that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re on right after the next two-minute station break, and it looks as if you&#x2019;ll have as much as fourteen or fifteen minutes with Mr. Carson.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wonderful! That will put me right up there with Carl Sagan and Paul Ehrlich!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What? Oh, yes&nbsp;...&nbsp;that&#x2019;s funny. Fun-ny.&#x201d; He wasn&#x2019;t smiling. &#x201c;Can you handle that much time okay?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Having done nearly two hours, only three nights earlier, on Larry King&#x2019;s network radio show, I patted Alfred&#x2019;s fuzzy cheek and replied, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try, son, I&#x2019;ll try.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Follow me, sir&nbsp;...&nbsp;and please watch your step. It&#x2019;s rather dark, backstage.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The band was playing on the other side of the curtain, entertaining the studio audience while the viewers across the nation were being instructed on the benefits of Alpo dog food and Jaymar slacks. Alfred leaned close to my right ear and shouted, &#x201c;Stand here, please, until I pull back the curtain. Then&#x2014;step out, take three steps forward, and turn right toward Mr. Carson. Careful you don&#x2019;t stumble when you step up onto that platform around his desk!&#x201d;</p><h2>Fear and Loathing in La Liga</h2><p><i>Fear and Loathing in La Liga</i> is the definitive history of the greatest rivalry in world sport: FC Barcelona vs. Real Madrid.

Learn the secrets of Folk Magic and the healing powers of powerful words given to us by the Angels of the Lord.</p><p> The Church has long sought to suppress the knowledge of powerful magic taken from the pages of the Holy Bible. Nevertheless, many people throughout the centuries have learned the secret of Bible Magic and have used these spells to enrich their lives, and the lives of others.</p><p> Now, for the first time, this hidden knowledge is brought together in one book by noted Biblical scholar Jessica C. Springfield. Springfield has spent years gathering this ancient, esoteric knowledge and presents it in a way easily understood in the modern era.</p><p> Most church leaders have convinced their parishioners that magic spells are the work of Satan and inherently evil. However, this is a centuries-long suppression of the fact that all churches practice magic rituals everyday as part of their services. The truth is that church leaders have kept these "Forbidden Bible Spells" from the general population to enrich and empower themselves with the magical forces intended for all of mankind. </p><p> Don't take this book lightly as the spells and incantations taken from the Bible are powerful and contain the very forces of Creation itself!</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Case Studies in Multicultural Counseling and Therapy</h2><p><p>"<i>Case Studies in Multicultural Counseling and Therapy</i> is a magnificent resource that will help create a greater bridge of understanding between the academic, research, and applied domains of the mental health professions."<br> &#x2014;From the Foreword by Thomas A.

Cunningham (Path to 9/11) and producer Grant Curtis (Spider-Man films).In ancient Israel, at the crossroads of the great trading routes, a man named Benaiah is searching for a fresh start in life. He has joined a band of soldiers led by a warlord named David, seeking to bury the past that refuses to leave him. Their ragged army is disgruntled and full of reckless men. Some are loyal to David, but others are only with him for the promise of captured wealth. While the ruthless and increasingly mad King Saul marches hopelessly against the powerful Philistines, loyal son Jonathan in tow, the land of the Hebrew tribes has never been more despondent&#x2015;and more in need of rescue. Over the course of ten days, from snowy mountain passes to sword-wracked battlefields, Benaiah and his fellow mercenaries must call upon every skill they have to survive and establish the throne for David&#x2015;if they don&#x2019;t kill each other first.</p><p><p>Cliff Graham is an Army veteran and the author of the Lion of War Series.

Importantly, her fame was not associated with shifting art styles and trends, but rather with her own unique vision, based on finding essential and abstract forms in nature.</p><p>O&#x2019;Keeffe&#x2019;s primary subjects were landscapes, flowers, and bones, each explored in successive series over several years. Certain works went on for decades, producing 12 or more variations of an original image. Among these, O&#x2019;Keeffe&#x2019;s magnified pictures of calla lilies and irises are her most famous. Enlarging the tiniest petals to fill an entire canvas, O&#x2019;Keeffe created a proto-abstract vocabulary of shapes and lines, earning her the moniker &#x201c;mother of American modernism.&#x201d; In 1946, O&#x2019;Keeffe became the first female artist to be given a solo show at the MoMA in New York.</p><p>This introductory book from TASCHEN Basic Art 2.0 traces O&#x2019;Keeffe&#x2019;s long and luminous career through key paintings, contemporary photographs, and portraits taken by Alfred Stieglitz, to whom O&#x2019;Keeffe was married. We follow the artist through her pioneering innovations, major breakthroughs, and her travels and inspirations in Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, and, above all, New Mexico, where she was particularly inspired by the majestic landscapes, vivid colors and exotic vegetation.</p></p><p>Britta Benke studied art history, classical archaeology and romance languages in G�ttingen, M�nster and Bonn.

First published in 1950, this book contains the first public revelation of the esoteric teachings of Alchemy, Tantra, Kabbalah, and the mysteries of the Mayans, Aztecs, Egyptians, Tibetans, Eleusians, Essenes, and hundreds more.</p><p>Thelema Press is a non-profit incorporation delivering to humanity the Gnostic Works of Samael Aun Weor.We have investigated all the great Gnostic treasures, and we have delved into the basis of all the archaic religions; thus, we have found the supreme key of sexual magic at the base of all cults. Now we deliver this treasure, this Key, to this suffering humanity. Many will read this book; however, few will comprehend it. The topic of this book is exclusively sexual magic. Indeed, those who are accustomed to read thousands of books out of pure intellectual curiosity will assuredly miss the opportunity to study this book in depth. It is worthless to read this book in a hurry. Those who proceed likewise are mistaken. It is necessary to profoundly study this book and to totally comprehend it, not only with the intellect but in all the levels of the mind. The intellect is only a small fraction of the mind. The intellect is not the whole mind. Therefore, whosoever understands this book only with the intellect has not understood it. Only with internal meditation is it possible to understand this book in all the levels of the mind. It is urgent to practice sexual magic in order to attain Christification. The reader will discover the supreme Key of intimate Self-realization within this book. We are not against any Religion, School, Sect, Order or Lodge because we know that all religious forms are manifestations of the Great Cosmic Universal Infinite Religion latent in every atom of the Cosmos. We just teach the synthesis of all Religions, Schools, Orders, Lodges and beliefs. Our doctrine is the Doctrine of the Synthesis. Sexual magic is practiced in esoteric Christianity. Sexual magic is practiced in Zen Buddhism. Sexual magic is practiced amongst the Initiated Yogis. Sexual magic is practiced amongst the Mohammedan Sufis. Sexual magic was practiced in the Initiatic Colleges of Troy, Egypt, Rome, Carthage, Eleusis. Sexual magic was practiced by the mysterious Maya, Aztec, Inca, Druids, etc. Therefore, sexual magic and the Cosmic Christ are the synthesis of all religions, schools and sects. We teach the Doctrine of the Synthesis. This doctrine could never be contrary to the diverse religious forms. Our teachings are found within all religions, schools and beliefs. If the reader makes a serious study of all the religions of the world, he will discover the phallus and uterus as the synthesis of all Mysteries. There has never been any authentic religion or school of mysteries where the Cosmic Christ and the mysteries of sex were absent. The Doctrine of the Synthesis cannot harm anyone, because it is the synthesis of all. We invite the devotees of all cults, schools and beliefs to make a comparative study of religions. We invite the students of all the diverse systems of intimate self-education to study the sexual esoterism from all the secret Schools of Mysteries. We invite all Yogis to study Sexual Yoga and White Tantra from India, without which no Yogi is able to attain absolute liberation. Whatever be the name, sexual magic and Christ are the synthesis of all esoteric studies, religious forms, or educational systems. The attacks of which we have been victims, the persecutions, anathemas, and excommunications etc., are because of ignorance and lack of study. Any religious form or esoteric system enriches itself with the synthesis. The synthesis cannot harm anyone. This is the Doctrine of the Synthesis. We intensely love all religious forms. We know that all religious forms are the loving manifestation of the Great Cosmic Universal Religion. The supreme religious synthesis is found within the Perfect Matrimony. God is Love and Wisdom. The ultimate synthesis of all Lodges, Orders, Schools, Sects, systems and methods of intimate Self-realization, from the East as from the West, from the North as from the South, is found within Christ and within sex.

We stayed in the tunnels too of course, the deeper tunnels where no sunlight came at all, but we weren&#x2019;t Hunchers.</p><p>We weren&#x2019;t even people anymore.</p><p>When Margaret saw that her home had been broken into, she didn&#x2019;t hesitate. She tossed off her flip-flops and marched right for the open trapdoor with me behind her, not caring whether I followed, not caring how many of them there were, and there had to be at least two to pull the chain and get that trapdoor up&#x2014;it was a big heavy bastard of a door made from part of an old subway car and broken-up seats.

She was our duly elected mayor.</p><p>&#x201c;Goddamn it,&#x201d; she whispered, kicking a peeping shower of rats out of her way. She picked up and threw down a shred of a hamburger wrapper in disgust. Whoever they were, they had brought food. You <i>don&#x2019;t</i> bring food into the loops.</p><p>They had tied belts together to lower themselves into the hole. A weak light danced down there, a flashlight, and I heard the sound of a lighter. Somebody sneezed a wet one. Somebody else laughed.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t bother with the belts. Just dropped down. I stayed up and watched. This was really a job for one vampire. Normally Old Boy or Ruth would have handled this. Old Boy was like her part-time bodyguard, lived in an abandoned train car just down the tracks past Purgatory, but he was a secretive fucker and you never knew where he was. Ruth was out hunting. She was always hungry.</p><p>Turns out there were four of them, the intruders, I mean; black guy and three whites, but with Hunchers the race thing gets less important because they&#x2019;re always dirty and dirt has one color. These guys looked hard, prison tattoos, prison muscles, probably came from the tracks under the Bowery. Guys under the Bowery are mostly wanted men and ex-cons, hunching down there in the piss-smelling dark rather than going back to Attica, which doesn&#x2019;t say much for Attica. They weren&#x2019;t from the tracks above our tunnels. We had a few Hunchers above us, but not many and they knew better; our guys would sooner take a whiz on the third rail than walk into our loops.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Whoa!&#x201d;</i> the black guy said when the fast-moving woman-thing in the bathrobe landed near where he lay back on the couch, Margaret&#x2019;s prized antique couch, and he jumped and dropped his flashlight.</p><p>One of the white guys said, &#x201c;Shit!&#x201d;</p><p>Margaret snatched up the flashlight. Shone it at them each in turn. Not that she needed it, just wanted to make sure they were good and night-blind.</p><p>Two of them spoke at once.</p><p>&#x201c;Get that out of my face!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bitch, you&#x2019;d best get out of here if you know what&#x2019;s good for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk like that to my mom,&#x201d; I said in my high, little-boy voice. I have a great little-boy voice, but I had barely gotten <i>mom</i> out before she started. She started by breaking the flashlight on the black guy&#x2019;s head&#x2014;Margaret&#x2019;s a little racist, but it&#x2019;s not her fault, she&#x2019;s Irish. Or maybe he got it first because he was on her couch. Either way, you know how these things go, everything happens in a hurry. The hurt guy yelled, everybody stood up or tried to, there was a sick <i>thump</i> as somebody&#x2019;s head got stove in, then another one, but I admit the gunshots surprised me. I saw it all from the trapdoor, but what did it look like for the poor bastard with the gun?</p><p>His muzzle flashes, and there were two, lit up a dead woman with shining eyes and big dirty canines that belonged on a panther. He yelled before she even touched him. One bullet hit her, the second ricocheted madly in the vaulted brick room. And then she touched him plenty.</p><p>The last guy tripped over the coffee table trying to find the belt to climb up. She was on top of him then, putting her knee in his back and pulling his head by the hair at his temples while he went, &#x201c;Gah! Gah!&#x201d; until she rocked back like she meant it, his spine popped, and he yelled. She pulled his snotrag from where it tongued out of his back pocket and stuffed it into his mouth, this to shut him up, but he lost consciousness anyway.</p><p>She stood up then, a little wobbly, and said something garbled. She spat out a rope of blood.</p><p>I leapt down, landed on one of the dead guys, pocketed the dropped Zippo, and sat on the wooden chair. Not the couch.</p><p>&#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>She spat again, bloody with a tooth in it.</p><p>She put up one wait-a-minute finger and I realized what had happened. She was in pain. He had shot her in the mouth and her busted mouth was forming up again. That didn&#x2019;t take long. Eyes take longer. You don&#x2019;t want to get your eye hurt in a fight.</p><p>&#x201c;I said,&#x201d; she said, slurring just a little on top of her thick-as-bread Conny-whatsis accent, &#x201c;never call me your mother again.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>A DOOR INTO NIGHT</p><p>I like the taste of sweat.</p><p>How it runs from the head, through the hair, like water filtering down through earth and tree roots into a spring; only instead of getting purer, sweat gets filthier, picks up grit, maybe tobacco, a hint of shampoo, but under and through all of that is salt. Almost too much salt, like honey was almost too sweet, what I remember of honey. They say the tongue&#x2019;s cut up into little provinces, salty, sour, bitter, sweet. I don&#x2019;t know if that&#x2019;s true, but I do know that salt is about the only taste I enjoy now. Salt in blood is the best, of course, and blood is a feast: iron-coppery and personal and as good in the stomach as ever was a steak. Sweat can&#x2019;t satisfy, not by itself, but it does hint at what&#x2019;s next. Sweat is to blood as dirty talk is to sex. It&#x2019;s an offer. It&#x2019;s a tease.</p><p>If I can, if I&#x2019;m not too hungry, if I have time, I lick before I bite, with the flat of the tongue like a dog. Maybe your eyes are half-closed because this is sexual for you, or maybe you&#x2019;re good and scared and making that ripe, rotten fear sweat I shouldn&#x2019;t love but do. Maybe my hands are tangled in your hair so you can&#x2019;t run, or maybe you&#x2019;re so charmed you&#x2019;re smiling like an idiot and leaning down to me so if anyone sees, they think I&#x2019;m telling you a secret. In a way, I am.</p><p>The secret is <i>vampires are real and I am one and no cop is coming and no doctor can help you and your own mother won&#x2019;t believe you if you tell her</i>. The secret is <i>I look like a high school freshman but I&#x2019;m pushing sixty</i>. And the secret is <i>I&#x2019;m stealing from you what is most truly yours and I&#x2019;m not sorry</i>.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>My name is Joey Peacock. I live in the tunnels under the subways. And don&#x2019;t go thinking the underground is so bad for us. It would be for you, if you&#x2019;re still warm, but things change when you&#x2019;re turned. Darkness isn&#x2019;t so dark anymore. Everything seems candlelit, even the blackest black, so that what looks to you like black dirt and a wall covered with black mold takes on a kind of warm glow for us, full of layer and detail like modern art, not that Guggenheim shit, but the pretty stonework-type stuff. Or like Rothko. You know Rothko? He&#x2019;s at the Guggenheim, but he&#x2019;s different. First time I saw one, I thought, <i>What&#x2019;s the big deal, squares of color, so what? </i>But there was something about it. A foxy European chick with a scarf and high boots was staring at it and I said, &#x201c;What do you see?&#x201d; and she said, &#x201c;Just keep looking,&#x201d; so I did. I think she was French. But she was right. The edges of the square of color started waving and then the painting glowed, like it was full of radiation. She said, &#x201c;Did a door open for you?&#x201d; and I said, &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>Night&#x2019;s like that now. It&#x2019;s always been there, full of radiation or whatever, and maybe that&#x2019;s what cats stare at when they look off into nothing but now I see it, too. When I first changed, I used to spend hours under bridges and down under manholes just trying to count the different kinds of black. Only none of it was exactly black anymore. I know I can&#x2019;t make you see it, but it&#x2019;s like <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, only flipped. Above the tunnels in the neon and lightbulbs, that&#x2019;s like black-and-white, boring-old-uncles Kansas. Down in the tunnels isn&#x2019;t exactly exploding with Munchkinland colors, but it is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. incandescent. That&#x2019;s a pretty word. That&#x2019;s a five-dollar word, but it works. The tunnels are gently, subtly incandescent. They breathe. They are most certainly not ugly.</p><p>Know what&#x2019;s ugly? Sunlight. Even looking at it indirectly is like staring into the jet of a welder&#x2019;s torch, all that light bouncing off the sidewalk and off the chrome of cars. Even peeking at it from the shadow of a manhole cover hurts. Overcast days make us queasy, unless we wear sunglasses. We all have sunglasses.</p><p>And don&#x2019;t go thinking that because I live underground I let myself go. I&#x2019;m a good-looking kid, kind of young Frank Sinatra&#x2013;ish, and I&#x2019;m not going to spoil all that by letting myself get ratty-looking. The Hunchers, they don&#x2019;t care, they&#x2019;re here because they&#x2019;re running away or sinking or already sunk. They live on flattened-out pieces of cardboard because they&#x2019;re too lazy to steal rugs and they camp out in Grand Central or Penn Station where people can see how dirty and sad they are and they beg. They let their hair knot up and their fingernails have quarter moons of muck under them; they run around covered in grease and filth and they crawl under their sleeping bags with rats peeping at them and drink brake fluid or sniff glue or cut themselves with broken glass or whatever, but the point is they&#x2019;re nasty. They eat rats, call them track-rabbits. Not all of them are so bad, but most of them. There&#x2019;s one black woman living up above us, mostly on the streets, sometimes at Union Square station, I don&#x2019;t know how she keeps the weight on, but she&#x2019;s like an island. Won&#x2019;t look at any of us directly, I think she knows what we are, everyone calls her Mama. Mama has two shopping carts full of stuff, all organized though, like neat. Shoes in one bag, shirts in another. But filthy.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t have anything to do with Hunchers, except to feed on them sometimes. Just sometimes. They&#x2019;re mostly full of booze, and booze hurts on the way out, or drugs, which give me a headache. We&#x2019;re much cleaner. Like cats. That&#x2019;s it, they&#x2019;re rats and we&#x2019;re cats. None of them have nice clothes, but that&#x2019;s maybe not their fault. They&#x2019;re poor.</p><p>Me, I got money. I charm people out of it all the time, and I use most of it to keep myself looking sharp. I have three mirrors, and don&#x2019;t go believing that baloney about us not reflecting. We reflect. We just don&#x2019;t show up so good in photographs. We blur. You know that guy who never takes a good picture? Ask yourself if you only see that guy at night. If the answer is yes, maybe don&#x2019;t spend any time alone with him, you know what I&#x2019;m saying? Maybe only hang out in big groups.</p><p>Nice clothes are important to me, even if they&#x2019;re hard to keep clean down here. There&#x2019;s a big trough or basin not far from my room; everybody uses that to wash clothes and bathe. Fill it up and you could only just keep your chin above water sitting down, not that we fill it all the way because the spigot&#x2019;s not hooked up and it takes so long to get water from the busted pipe we use. Somebody sunk a big hook in the roof above the basin, a long time ago; it&#x2019;s rusty now, and there used to be a pulley and a rotten old rope hanging from it, but it was in the way so Margaret got rid of it. There&#x2019;s like twenty bars of soap around the tub we use and share, plus a couple of boxes of detergent and an oldey-timey washboard. Me, I hate doing laundry by hand. I keep a jar of quarters for the Laundromat and I use a dry cleaner on 3rd Avenue who doesn&#x2019;t ask questions. I like the mod look: tight coats, paisley, zipper boots. I know I look a little dated when I walk into the disco, and like a throwback when I hit the punk club. Sometimes I wear a fedora, which looks funny on a young guy, but I remember when you&#x2019;d sooner leave your house without your nuts than without a good hat. I remember when you used to have to take your hat off in elevators and houses and when you spoke to a woman; some people still do that. I don&#x2019;t bother.</p><p>We get water from a pipe that&#x2019;s probably been busted fifty years. Just enough water gets out of it to run down the wall and somebody chiseled out a kind of groove near the bottom, like a niche just big enough to fit a bucket into. It takes about a minute and a half to fill a bucket. We have a cheap fold-up table for folding laundry and whatnot, we keep it near that big concrete trough; I think this place, our common place, used to be some kind of a cleaning station. Anyway, there&#x2019;s mold and dirt all caked on the wall except where the water runs out of its rusty pipe, but the wall is clean where the water washes down in a footlong track. The pipe is really rusty, that&#x2019;s how you can tell it&#x2019;s old. Some joker even wrote RUST where the water runs, chiseled it into the wall and there&#x2019;s still flecks of white paint in the letters, but the water washed most of it away. People must have been using this for a long time. It&#x2019;s kind of beautiful there, the way we see, though you would probably think it was just a wet wall with crap all around it and a busted pipe. You&#x2019;d probably rather have a milk shake than a quart of blood, too, so we&#x2019;ll have to agree to disagree. Anyway, I&#x2019;m glad I have a way to wash my hair. Having clean hair is maybe the most important part of looking attractive.</p><p>I love long hair, if it&#x2019;s clean. I don&#x2019;t have long hair myself because it makes it too hard to pass as a kid, and lit...</p></p><h2>Exploring Anatomy &amp; Physiology Laboratory: Core Concepts</h2><p><p>Exploring Anatomy &amp; Physiology Laboratory: Core Concepts, 2e, by Erin C.

He combines a profound Christian faith with an intimate understanding of ancient religious traditions.</p><p>Author Wayne Teasdale believes that we're entering the "Interspiritual Age," when a new civilization will be formed--a global culture based on common spiritual values. "Such a universal society will draw its inspiration from perennial spiritual and moral insights, intuitions, and experiences," Teasdale predicts. Throughout this ambitious book, Teasdale examines the world's religions and highlights the underlying beliefs and yearnings that will ultimately link humankind.<p> Nonetheless, Teasdale is also a proponent of spiritual diversity, urging readers to protect and study their own indigenous religions (or in many cases the religions of their childhoods) before rejecting them. In his glowing introduction, the Dalai Lama also speaks to the importance of preserving religions while simultaneously joining forces to create a more spiritually evolved and compassionate planet. In his final chapters, Teasdale offers ideas for cultivating a more spiritual life. Although his suggestions aren't startlingly original ("Gravitate toward silence," "Always leave the door of hope wide open.") they are tried and true and well worth the reader's time and investment. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Teasdale is a sannyasa, or Hindu monk, who also practices Roman Catholicism and serves on the board of trustees of the Parliament of the World's Religions. Here, he proclaims the advent of a new movement toward "interspirituality"--one that claims as its heritage all valid spirituality from any and all faiths. Teasdale distinguishes "spirituality" from "religion," explaining that "Being religious connotes belonging to and practicing a religious tradition. Being spiritual suggests a personal commitment to a process of inner development that engages us in our totality." For the author, religion is a potential means to the greater end of genuine spirituality, which is highly mystical. Teasdale identifies what he considers the main elements of true spirituality and their manifestation in various religious traditions. Although he is Catholic and the book appeals to the unity underlying all traditions, most of his terminology derives from Buddhist and Hindu sources. Teasdale's style is gentle and winsome. Those who disapprove of eclecticism in religion will at least find this a clear presentation to react against, while those who share Teasdale's optimistic vision of the coming age as fostering spiritual unity among diverse peoples will consider the book an inspirational guide.

Four days later, the B-17 assigned to the search-and-rescue mission became lost in a blinding storm and also crashed. Miraculously, all nine men on board survived, and the US military launched a daring rescue operation. But after picking up one man, the Grumman Duck amphibious plane flew into a severe storm and vanished.</p><p><em>Frozen in Time </em>tells the story of these crashes and the fate of the survivors, bringing vividly to life their battle to endure 148 days of the brutal Arctic winter, until an expedition headed by famed Arctic explorer Bernt Balchen brought them to safety. Mitchell Zuckoff takes the reader deep into the most hostile environment on earth, through hurricane-force winds, vicious blizzards, and subzero temperatures.</p><p>Moving forward to today, he recounts the efforts of the Coast Guard and North South Polar Inc. &#x2013; led by indefatigable dreamer Lou Sapienza &#x2013; who worked for years to solve the mystery of the Duck&#x2019;s last flight and recover the remains of its crew.</p><p>A breathtaking blend of mystery and adventure Mitchell Zuckoff's <em>Frozen in Time: An Epic Story of Survival and a Modern Quest for Lost Heroes of World War II </em>is also a poignant reminder of the sacrifices of our military personnel and a tribute to the everyday heroism of the US Coast Guard.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, April 2013</strong>: Talk about bad luck: In 1942, a United States cargo plane crash-landed while flying over Greenland, stranding the crew on sea of ice. A rescue flight was quickly dispatched--it crashed in a November storm, stranding its own nine crewmembers. The third time was not the charm: a second rescue mission disappeared in another blizzard, leaving neither clues nor apparent survivors. Subsequent attempts--some with fatal results--failed under the harsh conditions, forcing the men to weather the Arctic winter in makeshift shelters, including the tail section of a broken bomber. This tale of survival in the deadliest conditions would be enthralling on its own (and it is), but Zuckoff's meticulous research led him to a modern-day group dedicated to solving the mystery of the third flight. As a chronicler of their mission, Zuckoff is swept into their adventure, and his project becomes much more than an interesting World War II subplot. Part <i>Alive</i>, part Shackleton, <i>Frozen in Time</i> is a thrilling story of courage, perseverance, and loyalty that spans decades. --<i>Jon Foro</i>This book tells two true stories, one from the past and one from the present.<br><br> The historic story revolves around three American military planes that crashed in Greenland during World War II. First, a C-53 cargo plane slammed into the island's vast ice cap. All five men aboard survived the crash, and their distress calls triggered an urgent search. Next to go down was one of the search planes, a B-17 bomber, stranding nine more men on the ice. Finally, a Coast Guard rescue plane called a Grumman Duck vanished in a storm with three men aboard while trying to save the B-17 crew.<br><br> For nearly five months, through the Arctic winter of 1942-43, survivors and their would-be saviors fought to stay alive and sane in the most hostile environment on earth, clinging to life in snow caves and the tail section of the B-17. As the war raged on, America's military tried to rescue the icebound men by land, sea, and air, sometimes with fatal results. When hope seemed lost, a legendary aviator from the early days of flight devised a half-mad plan to land a seaplane on a glacier.<br><br> I learned about these events while hunting through newspaper archives for hidden treasures: stories that once captivated the world, only to fall through the cracks of history. After too many brassiere ads to count, I came across a 1943 series of newspaper articles titled "The Long Wait," about the crew of the wrecked B-17. Intrigued, I dug deeper, collecting declassified documents, maps, photographs, interviews, and previously unknown journals, seeking critical mass for a book.<br><br> Along the way, I stumbled upon a loose-knit society of men and women determined to locate the Grumman Duck's resting place and to bring home the remains of the three heroes it carried. Driving that effort was a tireless dreamer named Lou Sapienza, a photographer-turned-explorer who dedicated himself physically, financially, and emotionally to finding the frozen tomb of three men he knew only from faded photographs. Through Lou and his cohorts I met families who'd been waiting nearly seven decades for the return of their lost loved ones.<br><br> I also connected with Duck-devoted Coast Guardsmen who believed that all hands should be present and accounted for, one way or another. One in particular, Commander Jim Blow, committed himself with the same fervor he once gave to his work as a search-and-rescue pilot. Soon I realized that I couldn't tell the full story of the three crashes without also writing about the modern mission of the Duck Hunt.<br><br> In the summer of 2012 I joined Lou, Jim, and their combined civilian and military teams on a remote glacier in Greenland, where we experienced the world's unfinished attic firsthand. Together we used cutting-edge technology, an overlooked military crash report, and a yellowed treasure map complete with an X to solve one of the last mysteries from World War II.<br><br> Although written as a narrative, this is a work of nonfiction. As explained in my notes on sources, I took no liberties with facts, dialogue, characters, details, or chronology. Because the story moves between past and present, date markers such as "November 1942" and "October 2011" signal which tale is being told. Also, the historical story is written in past tense, while the modern story is in present tense.<br><br> I played a role in the Duck Hunt, and I appear in the book, but it isn't about me. It's about ordinary people thrust by fate or duty into extraordinary circumstances, one group in 1942 and another group seventy years later. Separated by time but connected by character, their bravery, endurance, and sacrifices reveal the power of humanity in inhumane conditions. I hope I've done them justice.</p><h2>The First Kiss: Undoing the Intake Model and Igniting First Sessions in Psychotherapy</h2><p>Many clients take the first step to see a psychotherapist and do not return after the first session.

Greg would not consider himself as somebody who takes Jesus seriously, but he admits to having questions. I didn't have a formula for him to understand how a Christian conversion works, but I told him that many years ago, when I was a child, I had heard about Jesus and found the idea of Him compelling, then much later while reading the Gospels, came to believe I wanted to follow Him. This changed things in my life, I said, because it involved giving up everything and choosing to go into a relationship with Him. Greg told me he had seen a pamphlet with four or five ideas on it, ideas such as man was a sinner, sin separated man from God, and Christ died to absolve the separation. He asked me if this was what I believed, and I told him, essentially, that it was. "Those would be the facts of the story," I said, "but that isn't the story."</p> <p>"Those are the ideas, but it isn't the narrative," Greg stated rhetorically.</p> <p>"Yes," I told him.</p> <p>Earlier that same year I had a conversation with my friend Omar, who is a student at a local college. For his humanities class, Omar was assigned to read the majority of the Bible. He asked to meet with me for coffee, and when we sat down he put a Bible on the table as well as a pamphlet containing the same five or six ideas Greg had mentioned. He opened the pamphlet, read the ideas, and asked if these concepts were important to the central message of Christianity. I told Omar they were critical; that, basically, this was the gospel of Jesus, the backbone of Christian faith. Omar then opened his Bible and asked, "If these ideas are so important, why aren't they in this book?"</p> <p>"But the Scripture references are right here," I said curiously, showing Omar that the verses were printed next to each idea.</p> <p>"I see that," he said. "But in the Bible they aren't concise like they are in this pamphlet. They are spread out all over the book."</p> <p>"But this pamphlet is a summation of the ideas," I clarified.</p> <p>"Right," Omar continued, "but it seems like, if these ideas are that critical, God would have taken the time to make bullet points out of them. Instead, He put some of them here and some of them there. And half the time, when Jesus is talking, He is speaking entirely in parables. It is hard to believe that whatever it is He is talking about can be summed up this simply."</p> <p>Omar's point is well taken. And while the ideas presented in these pamphlets are certainly true, it struck me how simply we had begun to explain the ideas, not only how simply, but how nonrelationally, how propositionally. I don't mean any of this to fault the pamphlets at all. Tracts such as the ones Omar and Greg encountered have been powerful tools in helping people understand the beauty of the message of Christ. Millions, perhaps, have come to know Jesus through these efficient presentations of the gospel. But I did begin to wonder if there were better ways of explaining it than these pamphlets. After all, the pamphlets have been around for only the last fifty years or so (along with our formulaic presentation of the gospel), and the church has shrunk, not grown, in Western countries in which these tools have been used. But the greater trouble with these reduced ideas is that modern evangelical culture is so accustomed to this summation that it is difficult for us to see the gospel as anything other than a list of true statements with which a person must agree.</p> <p>It makes me wonder if, because of this reduced version of the claims of Christ, we believe the gospel is easy to understand, a simple mental exercise, not in the least bit mysterious. And if you think about it, a person has a more difficult time explaining romantic love, for instance, or beauty, or the Trinity, than the gospel of Jesus. John would open his gospel by presenting the idea that God is the Word and Jesus is the Word and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. Not exactly bullet points for easy consumption. Perhaps our reduction of these ideas has caused us to miss something. </p> <p>o o o</p> <p> Each year I teach a class on the gospel and culture at a small Bible college back east. This year I asked the students to list the precepts a person would need to understand in order to become a Christian. I stood at the white board and they called out ideas: Man was sinful by nature; sin separates us from God; Jesus died for our sins; we could accept Jesus into our hearts (after some thought, students were not able to explain exactly what they meant by this, only saying it was a kind of interaction in which a person agrees Jesus is the Son of God), and so on. Then, looking at the board, I began to ask some questions about these almost universally accepted ideas. I asked if a person could believe all these ideas were true and yet not be a Christian. I told them my friend Matt, for instance, believed all these ideas and yet would never claim to be a person who knows Jesus or much less follows Him. The students conceded that, in fact, a person could know and even believe all the concepts on the board and yet not be a Christian. "Then there is something missing, isn't there?" I said to the class. "It isn't watertight just yet. There must be some idea we are leaving out, some full-proof thing a person has to agree with in order to have a relationship with Christ." We sat together and looked at the board for several minutes until we conceded we weren't going to come up with the missing element. I then erased the board and asked the class a different question: "What ideas would a guy need to agree with or what steps would a guy need to take in order to fall in love with a girl?" The class chuckled a bit, but I continued, going so far as to begin a list. </p> <p> 1. A guy would have to get to know her. </p> <p> I stood back from the board and wondered out loud what the next step might be. "Any suggestions?" I asked the class. We thought about it for a second, and then one of the students spoke up and said, "It isn't exactly a scientific process."</p> <p><b><i>The Gospel: A Relational Dynamic</i></b></p> <p>Perhaps the reason Scripture includes so much poetry in and outside the narrative, so many parables and stories, so many visions and emotional letters, is because it is attempting to describe a <i>relational</i> break man tragically experienced with God and a disturbed <i>relational</i> history man has had since then and, furthermore, a <i>relational</i> dynamic man must embrace in order to have relational intimacy with God once again, thus healing himself of all the crap he gets into while looking for a <i>relationship</i> that makes him feel whole. Maybe the gospel of Jesus, in other words, is all about our relationship with Jesus rather than about ideas. And perhaps our lists and formulas and bullet points are nice in the sense they help us memorize different truths, but harmful in the sense they delude, or perhaps ignore, the necessary relationship that must begin between ourselves and God for us to become His followers. And worse, perhaps our formulas and bullet points and steps steal the sincerity with which we might engage God. </p> <p>Becoming a Christian might look more like falling in love than baking cookies. Now don't get me wrong, I am not saying that in order for a person to know Jesus they must get a kind of crush on Him. But what I am suggesting is that, not unlike any other relationship, a person might need to understand that Jesus is alive, that He exists, that He is God, that He is in authority, that we need to submit to Him, that He has the power to save, and so on and so on, all of which <i>are</i> ideas, but ideas entangled in a kind of relational dynamic. This seems more logical to me because if God made us, wants to know us, then this would require a more mysterious interaction than what would be required by following a kind of recipe. </p> <p>I realize it all sounds terribly sentimental, but imagine the other ideas popular today that we sometimes hold up as credible: We believe a person will gain access to heaven because he is knowledgeable about theology, because he can win at a game of religious trivia. And we may believe a person will find heaven because she is very spiritual and lights incense and candles and takes bubble baths and reads books that speak of centering her inner self; and some of us believe a person is a Christian because he believes five ideas that Jesus communicated here and there in Scripture, though never completely at one time and in one place; and some people believe they are Christians because they do good things and associate themselves with some kind of Christian morality; and some people believe they are Christians because they are Americans. If any of these models are true, people who read the Bible before we systematically broke it down, and, for that matter, people who believed in Jesus before the printing press or before the birth of Western civilization, are at an extreme disadvantage. It makes you wonder if we have fashioned a gospel around our culture and technology and social economy rather than around the person of Christ. It doesn't make a great deal of sense that a person who went to Bible college should have a better shot at heaven than a person who didn't, and it doesn't make a lot of sense either that somebody sentimental and spiritual has greater access. I think it is more safe and more beautiful and more true to believe that when a person dies he will go and be with God because, on earth, he had come to know Him, that he had a relational encounter with God not unlike meeting a friend or a lover or having a father or taking a bride, and that in order to engage God he gave up everything, repented and changed his life, as this sort of extreme sacrifice is what is required if true love is to grow. We would expect nothing less in a marriage; why should we accept anything less in becoming unified with Christ? In fact, I have to tell you, I believe the Bible is screaming this idea and is completely...</p></p><h2>Momentum: Pursuing God&#39;s Blessings Through the Beatitudes</h2><p><p><b>The Beatitudes are not telling you how to become a Christian&#x2014;they tell you what a true Christian looks like.</b><br><br>Everyone wants to be blessed.

Pinduli promises to stay close by, but then trots off. She comes across a pack of wild dogs, a lion, and a zebra, and all tease her about her looks. She rolls in the dirt until her striped coat is a pallid gray and her ears are pinned back. The animals think that she is a "ghost" that has come for them. All of the creatures then confess that they teased the young hyena because another animal had made fun of them. The "ghost" understands and advises them to "find your tormentors and make peace....

His faithful assistant, Major Edward Lamb, galloped after him, clutching both their hats, and they sprang into a cab and rattled away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maisie stared after the hansom cab and sighed heavily. Where could they be going? It was bound to be somewhere exciting. Chasing jewel thieves, perhaps? Only yesterday, Gran&#x2019;s paper had said that they were on the trail of the Larradine Rubies at last. The newspaper article confidently expected the hunt to take them to India, possibly by way of Paris, or even Madrid. It had sounded wonderful. <i>Just imagine</i>, Maisie thought, <i>following footprints, spotting clues, trailing culprits</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust cast up by the cab horse&#x2019;s hooves settled slowly back onto the road, and Maisie set off again. Gran would be waiting for the fish she needed to cook for the lodgers&#x2019; supper. Maisie&#x2019;s grandmother ran a boarding house, and she spent all her time running around after the fussy lodgers. Maisie scuffed her boots along the pavement sadly. The fish smelled, and it was oozing out of its soggy paper parcel. She was almost certain that Gilbert Carrington never ate fish. He probably instructed his landlady never even to serve it. Certainly not in a parsley sauce, which Maisie really hated. Just because Madame Lorimer, who lived on the second floor of the boarding house, happened to have a fancy for fish, now Maisie would have to have it for her supper as well.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still. If she hadn&#x2019;t had to run out and fetch the fish, she&#x2019;d never have seen Gilbert Carrington, Maisie admitted to herself, cheering up a little. Perhaps he&#x2019;d been on his way to Scotland Yard? Perhaps he&#x2019;d solved the mystery of the rubies already?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maisie dawdled along, swinging the basket and daydreaming. If she walked along Laurence Road where Gilbert Carrington lived whenever she was sent out on errands, surely sooner or later she&#x2019;d meet someone on their way to consult the great detective? It was lucky that he lived so close to her grandmother&#x2019;s lodging house, on Albion Street. If only she could manage to run into one of his clients first, and deduce something amazing. Then she might be able to help him solve a mystery.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maisie smiled to herself as she imagined the great man pacing up and down his rooms. He probably had all sorts of peculiar things on the walls, things that he&#x2019;d picked up on his adventures. Strange African spears, sets of handcuffs, amazing jewels that people had given him after he&#x2019;d rescued them .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. treasure maps .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Carrington would be smoking his pipe&#x2014;he was quite often drawn with it in the newspaper cartoons, so Maisie knew he had one. She had borrowed a pipe once, from the young man who had the third-floor back bedroom, but trying to smoke it had made her sick. And the young man hadn&#x2019;t paid his rent, so she hadn&#x2019;t had a chance to try again. She wasn&#x2019;t sure it was strictly necessary to smoke a pipe to be a great detective, anyway, though it would have helped her look the part.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Edward,&#x201d; he would groan. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t see it. Something&#x2019;s missing. Some vital clue&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; And Maisie would step in, just then, and tell him what it was.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Carrington could always be having an off day, Maisie reasoned. It would only take him having a cold, after all. With a blocked-up nose, the great detective wouldn&#x2019;t be able to smell a thing, and smells could be vital.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she had a cold right now, she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to smell this disgusting fish.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maisie drew aside politely for an elderly lady in a smart black silk dress and an enormous bonnet to walk past. She tried to look at her as Gilbert Carrington would&#x2014;every bit of her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old lady looked exactly as she ought to, unfortunately. No odd color in her cheeks. No strange jewelry. But Maisie could pretend, just for practice.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another whiff of fish from the basket reminded her of smells. She ought to check for that. Perhaps the old lady smelled of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Maisie frowned to herself, as she tried to think what it could be. It would have to be something unusual, and noticeable .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sniffed thoughtfully. There was actually an odd smell. She just couldn&#x2019;t quite work out what it was.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aniseed! Maisie glanced over her shoulder in surprise. Of course, the old lady had probably just been eating aniseed balls, but she didn&#x2019;t look like an aniseed ball eater. They were a child&#x2019;s sort of sweet. Surely such a proper-looking person should smell of the usual old lady things. Like violet bonbons, and lavendery lace.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maisie gave a blissful little shiver. Perhaps the old lady was really a murderess, and she&#x2019;d used essence of aniseed to confuse a watchdog at her victim&#x2019;s house. Everyone knew that dogs loved aniseed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maisie took a few quick steps back down the road after the old lady, who glided on, her black silk dress whispering over the paving slabs. She didn&#x2019;t look like a murderess, but one never knew, after all. Maisie caught her breath, wondering if there was a weapon in the delicate little black reticule she was carrying. She felt in her pocket for her notebook, and the stub of a pencil. She might need to write down her observations .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old lady seemed to sense that she was being followed, and she turned back to glare at Maisie through a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez spectacles that she had drawn out of her little black bag. It was a particularly freezing glare, and Maisie wilted. She was almost certain that there wasn&#x2019;t room for a dagger or a pistol in the black bag, though. She scuttled away around the corner of the street, cursing herself for being careless and being seen. This detective thing was difficult. Gilbert Carrington would never have let himself be spotted.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maisie was feeling so ashamed of herself and her dreadful attempts at detection that she almost missed the sack. She had noticed it, of course, as she went past the alley. She was a noticing sort of person. That was what had made her so sure she would make a good detective, if only she was given the chance. At home, all she ever got to do was find Madame Lorimer&#x2019;s knitting, and it was almost always underneath the cushions on the sofa. It was simply a case of following the trail of cake crumbs to work out where the old lady had been sitting last.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was much more opportunity for detecting out on the streets. But Maisie had been glared at so thoroughly that all she wanted to do was hurry back home and give Gran the basket of fish.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>You&#x2019;re a coward, Maisie Hitchins</i>, she told herself. <i>What if she really was a murderess? One cross look and you run off like a startled hen</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If she was lucky, Gran would be in a good mood (if all the lodgers had paid their rent on time, and no one had complained about a dusty room, or the maid, Sarah-Ann, banging the fire irons). Maisie might even get away with being just a little late. She couldn&#x2019;t really have watched for that long on Laurence Road, could she? But the afternoon sunlight was definitely fading. She hurried past the pile of rubbish in the mouth of the little alleyway leading down to the muddy edge of the canal, and saw the low sun glittering on the water.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something made her stop and turn back. Why <i>was</i> there a sack on the pile of rubbish? It was a perfectly good sack, no rips or holes. It was tied up with a bit of old string, and that was odd, too. Who would bother tying up the top of a sack, just to throw it away? And the sack was dripping wet. That was what had made her turn back, Maisie decided, feeling rather pleased with herself. She must have noticed it without realizing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the sack had been in the canal, or there was something wet inside the sack that was leaking. Or possibly both.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maisie had been really hoping there was a bloodstained dagger in that old lady&#x2019;s little black reticule, so it was odd that she found herself unwilling to undo the sack and discover what was dripping out of it. A real detective wouldn&#x2019;t hesitate, she told herself crossly, stopping at the mouth of the alley. But what if it <i>was</i> a dagger? Or even worse, whatever the dagger had been used on? One did hear awful stories sometimes, about bits of people left lying around. Gilbert Carrington had managed to solve a murder once just from an ear sent by the penny post in a small brown paper parcel. She shuddered.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then that the sack wriggled and let out a despairing whimper.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maisie gasped, dropped the fish basket, and began to struggle with the damp string at once. There was an animal in there&#x2014;a dog, she guessed. &#x201c;Did someone drop you in the canal?&#x201d; she whispered, her red curls getting in her eyes as she tore at the knots. &#x201c;I hope you don&#x2019;t bite, although I wouldn&#x2019;t blame you if you did. How long have you been in here?&#x201d; She dragged the string away at last, and gently folded back the top of the sack.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out at her was a small, grubby, grayish-white face, with brown ears and dark, dark brown eyes. A puppy! Both of the ears were laid anxiously flat against his head, and he stared at Maisie as though he thought she was going to shout at him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Are you hurt?&#x201d; Maisie asked worriedly, wondering why he didn&#x2019;t jump out of the sack and run away. She&#x2019;d expected him to disappear as soon as she&#x2019;d set him free. &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re just too scared to go past me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; she murmured, stepping back a little.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The puppy twitched his shoulders and shook himself free, stepping carefully out of the folds of sacking. Then he hurried over to Maisie and sat down next to her boots.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Go home!&#x201d; Maisie told him. Then she sighed, shaking her head. &#x201c;Of course, you can&#x2019;t&#x2014;that was stupid. You probably don&#x2019;t have one. But you can&#x2019;t come home with me, you know. Gran won&#x2019;t have a dog in the house. They&#x2019;re too dirty and muddy. She wouldn&#x2019;t even have a cat&#x2014;she says animals make dust.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog simply stared up at her and didn&#x2019;t move. Maisie knew that she ought to shoo him away, but she couldn&#x2019;t. He seemed to have decided that he was hers now, and someone had clearly already tried to drown the poor little creature. If she didn&#x2019;t take him home with her, she couldn&#x2019;t see such a small, bedraggled dog lasting more than a day or so on the London streets. Someone would turn him into sausages if he walked down the wrong alleyway.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Gran isn&#x2019;t going to be happy if I bring you home,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to hide.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog shook his ears, as if he was trying to get the last of the water out.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, and I hate to say it, but you do smell rather. You might have to have a bath.&#x201d; Maisie sighed. &#x201c;Under the scullery pump, maybe. I can&#x2019;t see me smuggling you into the lodgers&#x2019; bathroom. Someone would see us, for sure.&#x201d; She crouched down and reached out a hand to rub the little dog&#x2019;s ears. He closed his eyes so blissfully when Maisie scratched them that she realized he probably had fleas.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Just how did you get out of the canal?</i> Maisie wondered as she scooped up the fish basket and set off down the road again, the dog trotting next to her, so close that his thin little tail slapped against her boots. &#x201c;I suppose it was quite a big sack. You must have scrabbled about inside it enough to stay afloat, and then got yourself washed up. If that&#x2019;s what happened, you were very lucky.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog glanced up at her brightly, as though to say that he made his own luck, and Maisie laughed. Now that he was drying out a bit, she noticed one of his ears was at a very funny angle, set a little sideways, like a daring, rakish sort of hat. He was very sweet, even if he was dirty. How could someone have tried to drown him?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I suppose,&#x201d; Maisie said thoughtfully, &#x201c;that all great detectives have a faithful companion, like Gilbert Carrington has Major Edward Lamb. He&#x2019;s supposed to be awfully good in a fight. He has a swordstick, according to the <i>Morning Post</i>, and he&#x2019;s saved Gilbert Carrington&#x2019;s life at least twice. Although of course Mr. Carrington has saved him hundreds of times.&#x201d; She looked down at the dog, who was sniffing at something disgusting in the gutter. &#x201c;Perhaps you&#x2019;ll save me one day,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You could be my companion. I think I&#x2019;ll call you Eddie&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State</h2><p><p><b>By Glenn Greenwald, star of <i>Citizenfour</i>, the Academy Award-winning documentary on Edward Snowden</b></p><p>In May 2013, Glenn Greenwald set out for Hong Kong to meet an anonymous source who claimed to have astonishing evidence of pervasive government spying and insisted on communicating only through heavily encrypted channels. That source turned out to be the twenty-nine-year-old NSA contractor Edward Snowden, and his revelations about the agency's widespread, systemic overreach proved to be some of the most explosive and consequential news in recent history, triggering a fierce debate over national security and information privacy.<br> Now Greenwald fits all the pieces together, recounting his high-intensity eleven-day trip to Hong Kong, examining the broader implications of the surveillance detailed in his reporting for <i>The Guardian</i>, and revealing fresh information on the NSA's unprecedented abuse of power with documents from the Snowden archive. Fearless and incisive, <i>No Place to Hide</i> has already sparked outrage around the globe and been hailed by voices across the political spectrum as an essential contribution to our understanding of the U.S. surveillance state.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2014:</strong> In May of 2013, Edward Snowden, a young systems administrator contracting for the National Security Agency, fled the United States for Hong Kong, carrying with him thousands of classified documents outlining the staggering capabilities of the NSA.&#x2019;s surveillance programs--including those designed to collect information within the U.S. There Snowden arranged a meeting with <em>Guardian</em> columnist Glenn Greenwald, and so began the most explosive leak of classified material since the Pentagon Papers, over 40 years ago. <em>No Place to Hide</em> opens with Greenwald&#x2019;s tense account of his initial cloak-and-dagger encounters with Snowden, then transitions into descriptions of the NSA&#x2019;s vast information-collection apparatus, including a selection of the &#x201c;Snowden files&#x201d; with commentary on the alphabet soup of agencies and code names. And--in typical Greenwald style--the book is packed with his opinions on government snooping, its legality, and the impacts on our Constitutional freedoms. Whether you consider Snowden a whistleblower crying foul on government overreach, or a self-aggrandizing traitor who put national security at risk, Greenwald&#x2019;s book is thrilling and enlightening, a bellwether moment in a crucial debate. <em>--Jon Foro</em></p><b>Glenn Greenwald</b> is the author of several best sellers, including <i>How Would a Patriot Act?</i> and <i>With Liberty and Justice for Some.</i> Acclaimed as one of the 25 most influential political commentators by <i>The Atlantic</i> and one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers by <i>Foreign Policy</i> for 2013, Greenwald is a former constitutional law and civil rights attorney. He was a columnist for <i>The Guardian</i> until October, 2013, and is now building a new media organization. He is a frequent guest on CNN, MSNBC and various other television and radio outlets. His NSA reporting in 2013 has won numerous awards, including the top investigative journalism award for the 2013 Online Journalism Association, the Esso Award for Excellence in Reporting (the Brazilian equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize), and the 2013 Pioneer Award from Electronic Frontier Foundation. He is also the recipient of the first annual I.F. Stone Award for Independent Journalism in 2009 and the 2010 Online Journalism Association Award for his investigative work on the arrest and detention of Bradley Manning.

Entrepreneur. Mentor. Executive. Servant. Visionary. Everyone has a different idea of what a leader should be. How can any one person be everything? Scott Rodin brings unity and clarity to this confusing, demanding picture of leadership. He offers a comprehensive model that brings together a biblical understanding of holistic stewardship with the best in leadership studies. Whether in churches, not-for-profit ministries or in business the need for sound leadership is readily apparent. Drawing on his years of experience in development and fundraising and his extensive theological training, Scott Rodin offers a new paradigm--a transformational approach to leadership that is biblically sound, theologically rich and practically compelling.</p><p><strong>R. Scott Rodin</strong> (Ph.D., University of Aberdeen) is managing principal of OneAccord NFP, and Senior Fellow of the Engstrom Institute. He has served as president of the Christian Stewardship Association and president of Eastern Baptist (now Palmer) Theological Seminary. He is the author of five books, including <em>Stewards in the Kingdom.</em>"In an age of pragmatism where effective leadership is often defined by outcomes which work, Scott Rodin offers us a refreshing paradigm shift. Rather than focusing primarily on the necessary acquisition of leadership skill sets or leadership development techniques or the pursuit of outcomes, Rodin maintains that the place for the leader to start and thereafter live is with the unseen part of the laeder, the part that God knows and sees." (Eugene Habecker, Dynamic Stewardship, January-March 2011)<br><br>"The body of work on leadership is so massive that one could wonder if any new words are needed. There are some--and Scott Rodin has offered them in the form of a theology of leadership that is grounded in stewardship and freedom. This book is an inspiring addition to the many writings on leadership theory, practice and characteristics. I believe that those called to lead will find <em>The Steward Leader</em> particularly meaningful and formational." (David R. Black, president, Eastern University)<br><br>"In an age of pragmatism where effective leadership is often defined by outcomes which work, Scott Rodin offers us a refreshing leadership paradigm shift. Rather than focusing primarily on the necessary acquisition of leadership skill sets or leadership development techniques, or the pursuit of outcomes, Rodin maintains that the place for the leader to start and thereafter live is with the unseen part of the leader, the part that God knows and sees." (Eugene Habecker, president, Taylor University, and author of Rediscovering the Soul of Leadership)<br><br>"Finally, a much-needed and long-awaited word on what it really takes to effectively serve the kingdom of our Lord! Rodin, with wisdom and courage, takes the reader on a journey in leading. This text is for serious leaders who are prepared to be faced with the twenty-first-century demand for 'being' over 'doing.' You will be challenged and affirmed by this inspiring, scholarly presentation. This book deserves a place in your library!" (Israel L. Gaither, national commander, The Salvation Army)<br><br>"Scott Rodin's <em>The Steward Leader</em> presents a fresh and powerful way to think about what it means to be a Christian leader. In essence, he argues that asking how to become a better leader, or even how to provide more effective leadership, is asking the wrong question. A better question is <em>How can we be more Christlike as we lead?</em> Compellingly, Dr. Rodin shows how taming our self-elevating nature and reflecting the image of a triune God revealed in Christ and Scripture will inevitably make us better leaders. He draws honestly upon his vast experience and faithfully upon the riches of Scripture to help us be better Christ-followers. Getting that right will help us be better leaders more than any how-to-lead book ever written (including mine!). <em>The Steward Leader</em> is a very valuable guide to any Christian leader who is willing to accept that leading is all about <em>being.</em>" (Bill Robinson, president, Whitworth University, Spokane, Washington)<br><br>"No discussion of leadership is ultimately very meaningful without filtering it through the teachings of Jesus Christ. I have found much that is helpful and inspirational in this book, and I have every confidence that anyone who reads <em>The Steward Leader</em> will too." (Richard Stearns, president, World Vision U.S., and author of The Hole in Our Gospel)<br><br>"In a time of Christian leadership thinking and practice that often are not much more than a sacred glazing of a secular ham, Scott Rodin's <em>Steward Leader</em> proposition -offers a refreshing perspective on the character and volition of those who seek to follow Jesus in their positions of influence. Moving beyond 'how to' formulas, Scott challenges us to examine our 'why to' motivations. His personal transparency, insightful analyses and clarion call to action prepare the way for a revolution in Christian leadership for just such critical times as these." (David J.

These daily readings construct a simple blueprint for positive problem solving, such as dealing with situations and relationships typically difficult for people with dual disorders.<br> <br> Readings also: provide practical demonstrations of effectively handling emotions, mild paranoia, and other difficulties; state an affirmation and acknowledge a common problem; provide insight for positive change; and offer motivation to complete one simple, concrete goal for the day.</p><p>Tim Mc is a contributor to Hazelden publications including <i>Today I Will Do One Thing.</i><b>Introduction</b><br><br>This "meditation" book is different from other meditation books because <i>dual</i> recovery from a <i>dual</i> disorder is different. It needs awareness and acceptance of two problems--addiction as well as emotional or psychiatric illness--which are both similar and different, <i>interdependent</i> and independent.<br><br><i>The design of this book</i><br>By reading this book regularly, you will learn about the process of recovery from a dual disorder. But it does not tell you what to do, it simply <i>shows</i> you what some mythical people may have done, or thought, in the course of a mythical year. You may also think of these entries as the diary of a composite person, an Everyman or Everywoman, who is actively recovering from a dual disorder and has learned some things. The entries record this person's problems and pain as well as record the moments of insight or awareness, however limited, that make it possible to accept the problem and begin to deal with it. In a way, this book can be seen as a model, although the path it represents is only one of many paths to dual recovery. Thus, every entry will not apply to everyone's recovery--take what you like and leave the rest.<br><br>Though mythical, or composite, these feelings, experiences, and actions are based on those of real people in dual recovery.<br><br>Clearly this meditation book differs from its cousins. It is written in the first person, essentially in the present tense. It tends to be simpler and shorter than other books, more educational, more direct, and more concrete.<br><br>Each entry, which has four parts, begins with the title, an affirmation in itself. The opening paragraph then identifies the pain or problem. The following paragraph explores some awareness or insight into it, arrived at through a combination of experience, memory, and the mysterious state of grace called "Aha!" The last paragraph, usually a single brief sentence, offers a simple and concrete action step--such as might be suggested by someone who cares about you and understands your problem and your process--one that will move you in the direction of recovery, no matter how small the step.<br><br>Why are the entries set up this way? Because awareness and acknowledgment bring about acceptance. Acceptance allows for action (or appropriate inaction). Appropriate action, no matter how small, results in change and growth. This is the nature of recovery.<br><br><i>Some assumptions</i><br>While perhaps many in recovery can find support in this book, those with a dual disorder will feel more at home, will be most rewarded. You need a book that accepts and understands your particular struggles.<br><br>As a person in recovery from a dual disorder, chances are that<ul><li>you are relatively new to recovery, whether from addiction or from emotional or psychiatric illness; </li><li>you are becoming increasingly aware of your two illnesses, regardless of which came first, which is more problematic, or which you're focusing on right now; </li><li>you are in some form of counseling or therapy (or are considering it); </li><li>you are taking a psychiatric medication (or might consider it); </li><li>you are working a Twelve Step program (or have some awareness of the Twelve Step fellowship, or are willing to participate in it); you are willing to apply its principles to recovery from both illnesses; </li><li>you have a support person (or are willing to get one), whether in a Twelve Step fellowship (especially Dual Recovery Anonymous) or some other support program; </li><li>you have a plan for recovery (or are willing to develop one with the help of a counselor, therapist, or support person); </li><li>you are willing to reflect on your emotions and actions and make notes about what is going on in your life--since journaling yields greater insight than "thinking" alone. Moreover, it yields a written record that can reveal progress and problems.</li></ul><i>Some terms</i><br>Since the language of recovery may differ among treatment providers and kinds of recovery; here is a list of important words as they are used in this book.<ul><li><i>Drugs</i> usually means street drugs, but sometimes it includes alcohol (as in the phrase "alcohol and other drugs"). Drugs, however, never refers to (prescribed) medication. </li><li><i>High</i> means intoxication by either street drugs or alcohol. </li><li><i>Cravings,</i> as used in addiction recovery; are considered a less immediate threat to abstinence or sobriety, and easier to deal with, than "urges." With urges, one is very close to having a slip. </li><li><i>Group</i> refers to a Twelve Step group, a mental health support group, or other recovery group. Usually the kind of group is specified. </li><li><i>Symptoms</i> is shorthand for psychiatric symptoms. </li><li><i>Meds</i> is short for psychiatric medication.</li></ul>Finally, although the Twelve Step fellowship uses the words "God" and "higher power," some people object to them. This book occasionally offers two substitutes, "helping power" and "source of power." Feel free, however, to use any words that work for you.<br><br><i>How to use this book</i><br>Although the style of this book is different, use it as you might use any other meditation book. Read entries according to the day of the month, regardless of where you are in recovery; check the index to find entries that speak to your day's concerns, for example, stigma, relapse, medication, or the Twelve Steps; or simply pick readings that appeal to you.<br><br><i>To keep in mind</i><br>The wellspring of this book is compassion. As you read it, please know that you are not alone, that there are people who can help, and that things will get better.<br></p><h2>Disaster Preparedness for EMP Attacks and Solar Storms (Expanded Edition)</h2><p><p>What would happen if terrorists detonated a nuclear device high above the United States? What about if the Sun emitted a large coronal mass ejection that resulted in a damaging geomagnetic storm? In either case, electrical power could be lost for months. Shortages would quickly ensue&#x2014;food, water, and fuel would disappear within days. Widespread panic and suffering would be unavoidable. Are you prepared for these large-scale disasters? </p> <p>This book will help you to prepare for two end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it (TEOTWAWKI) events: the EMP attack and the solar storm. Each threat is carefully studied with analyses of its likelihood and potential impacts on our nation&#x2019;s critical infrastructures. Practical preparations are outlined, including steps to meet the fourteen basic needs in the absence of modern utilities, and the use of Faraday cages and uninterruptible power supplies to protect personal electronics. Several techniques for constructing ad-hoc Faraday cages are presented. The shielding effectiveness of homemade Faraday cages is measured and compared, including metal garbage cans, foil-wrapped boxes, fire safes, anti-static bags, ammo cans, microwave ovens, and full-sized protective rooms.</p> <p>The Expanded Edition includes 25 additional pages with discussions of how to establish your own micro-infrastructures, such as food, water, and electricity. Also, the susceptibility and protection of personal automobiles is presented.</p> <p>To sign up for Dr. Bradley's free Practical Prepper Newsletter , see http://disasterpreparer.com.</p></p><p>Dr. Arthur Bradley holds a doctorate in engineering from Auburn University and currently works for NASA.

There, in a cave hidden high above the ocean, they discover a fabulous creature: a glittering three-headed golden dragon with a kind heart, an unpredictable temper, and a memory that spans 20,000 years. Transported by the magic of the dragon's stories, the children meet Mei-lan, a young girl in ancient China; nineteenth-century cabin boy Jamie Pritchett; and, in more recent times, Hitty and her brother, Will, who survive a frightening plane crash on a desert island. In this fluidly written novel, Rebecca Rupp explores what three children from the present learn from the past &#x2014; and from an unlikely but wise and generous friend.</p><p>Rebecca Rupp lives in Vermont with her husband and three sons, three cats, and a large garden full of heirloom tomatoes. Of THE DRAGON OF LONELY ISLAND, she says, &#34;We once had an invisible pet dragon named Petunia, plus did an awful lot of childhood reading.&#34;They strode along, single file because the old path was so narrow. Sarah Emily hummed as she walked. Zachary paused every once in a while to check directions on his compass. Hannah dabbed sunscreen on her nose. Soon Zachary and Sarah Emily were hungry again &#x2014; "I can't believe you two, after eating all those doughnuts," said Hannah &#x2014; so they paused, just at the foot of the hill, for a sandwich (peanut butter and Mrs. Jones's homemade strawberry jam), a cookie, and a drink of lemonade. Zachary's freckles began to come out in the sun. Sarah Emily crumpled the last sandwich wrapper and tucked it back into Zachary's pack. "Let's go to the very top," she said, "and look for China."<br><br>"Wrong direction and wrong ocean," said Hannah. "Try France."<br><br>"Or Greenland," said Zachary. "Last one to the top is a rotten egg!" He grabbed the pack and began to run, bounding up the little path, winding in and out around scattered boulders.<br> <br>Hannah and Sarah Emily-shouting "Hey!" and "Wait for me!"-dashed after him. <br><br>The hill was steeper than it looked. Soon the children were breathless, and one after another they slowed, panting, to a walk. They were hot, and the backs of Sarah Emily's legs began to ache. They staggered up the last few feet and collapsed, laughing, against the huge heap of piled rocks that formed the very peak of Drake's Hill. Zachary raised his fist in triumph. "Excelsior!" he shouted.<br><br>The view from the hill was spectacular. From their height, they could trace the coast of the island and gaze far out to sea. "I feel like I've just climbed Mount Everest," said Hannah. <br><br>"Let's get right up on top of these rocks," said Zachary. "Then we'll be able to see everything in both directions."<br><br>They scrambled up the side of the great heap of gray boulders, scrabbling for footholds as they climbed. The rocks were piled like giant jumbled steps. There were short heaving climbs &#x2014; Sarah Emily, whose legs were short, needed to be boosted by Zachary and Hannah &#x2014; then expanses of level flatness, then more steep climbs. At the last flat step, as they approached the peak, they came to a smooth, sheer wall, higher than Hannah's head, with not so much as a crack or a crevice in sight. "Let's go back," said Sarah Emily. "It's too high."<br><br>But Zachary refused to give up.<br><br>"Maybe we can get up from the other side," he said.<br><br>The step &#x2014; more like a rocky shelf &#x2014; curved around to the right, almost like a walkway circling the very top of the hill. The children cautiously edged their way around it. Sarah Emily, who hated heights, refused to look down. On the north side of the rock face, the shelf suddenly widened out into a broad platform, high above and overlooking the empty sea.<br><br>"Look at that!" gasped Sarah Emily.<br><br>"A cave!" said Zachary. <br><br>At the back of the stone platform, a wide gaping opening led back into darkness.<br><br>"Let's go inside," said Zachary eagerly, but Sarah Emily hung back. <br><br>"Let's not," she said. "There could be anything in there. Bears or something. And besides, it smells funny."<br><br>Zachary and Hannah sniffed the air. Near the cave entrance, there was a strange odor: the smell of charcoal and smoke, with a hint of something tangier, spicy, alien. <br><br>"Probably just old campfires," said Zachary. "Maybe Mr. and Mrs. Jones used to come up here and roast marshmallows." He peered blindly into the darkness, then turned to fumble in his backpack. "Just a minute," he said. "I brought my flashlight."<br><br>He switched it on and cautiously stepped forward into the cave. Sarah Emily and Hannah crowded behind him. The three children, clinging to each other, edged slowly inward. As they moved into the cave, the sound of the sea abruptly shut off, as though someone had thrown a massive switch. The cave floor seemed to slant downward into the hill, and inside, it felt enormous; there was a sense of soaring subterranean spaces. Zachary's flashlight barely penetrated the gloom. "It didn't look this big from the outside," Sarah Emily whispered. Groping, they stretched out their arms, left and right, to the sides.<br><br>"Can anybody feel a wall anywhere?" Zachary asked softly. Nobody could.<br><br>"This place is simply huge," said Hannah. "The whole inside of the hill must be hollow."<br><br>"It feels endless," said Sarah Emily nervously.<br><br>The children shuffled forward, feeling gingerly with their feet. "There could be deep holes," said Sarah Emily. The strange sharp smell &#x2014; smoke? sulfur? &#x2014; got stronger.<br><br>"You know what I wonder?" said Zachary. "Where did this hill get its name anyway? Was the sea captain who built the house named Drake? How come it's called Drake's Hill?"<br><br>There was a sudden shifting sound from the back of the cave, a heavy sandpapery scraping noise. Then there came a soft hiss in the darkness &#x2014; the sound of a lighted blowtorch, thought Zachary &#x2014; and a red-and-yellow flare of flame. The interior of the cave leaped into light. Before the children's astonished eyes, a vast expanse of gold flashed and glittered. There before them lay a long reptilian body, curled comfortably on the cave floor, with a coiled golden tail, ending in a flat arrowhead-shaped point. Two eyes-sharp slits of jade green-glared at them out of the darkness.<br><br>"It is called Drake's Hill, young man," said a deep, raspy voice, "because drake is an ancient and honorable name for dragon. The hill is named after me."<br><br>_______<br><br>THE DRAGON OF LONELY ISLAND by Rebecca Rupp. Copyright (c) 2006 by Rebecca Rupp. Published by Candlewick Press, Inc., Cambridge, MA.</p><h2>The Art of Rivalry: Four Friendships, Betrayals, and Breakthroughs in Modern Art</h2><p><b>Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning art critic Sebastian Smee tells the fascinating story of four pairs of artists&#x2014;Manet and Degas, Picasso and Matisse, Pollock and de Kooning, Freud and Bacon&#x2014;whose fraught, competitive friendships spurred them to new creative heights.</b><br><br> Rivalry is at the heart of some of the most famous and fruitful relationships in history. <i>The Art of Rivalry</i> follows eight celebrated artists, each linked to a counterpart by friendship, admiration, envy, and ambition. All eight are household names today. But to achieve what they did, each needed the influence of a contemporary&#x2014;one who was equally ambitious but possessed sharply contrasting strengths and weaknesses.<br><br> Edouard Manet and Edgar Degas were close associates whose personal bond frayed after Degas painted a portrait of Manet and his wife. Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso swapped paintings, ideas, and influences as they jostled for the support of collectors like Leo and Gertrude Stein and vied for the leadership of a new avant-garde.&nbsp;Jackson Pollock&#x2019;s uninhibited style of &#x201c;action painting&#x201d; triggered a breakthrough in the work of his older rival, Willem de Kooning. After Pollock&#x2019;s sudden death in a car crash, de Kooning assumed Pollock's mantle and became romantically involved with his late friend&#x2019;s mistress.&nbsp;Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon met in the early 1950s, when Bacon was being hailed as Britain&#x2019;s most exciting new painter and Freud was working in relative obscurity. Their intense but asymmetrical friendship came to a head when Freud painted a portrait of Bacon, which was later stolen. <br><br> Each of these relationships culminated in an early flashpoint, a rupture in a budding intimacy that was both a betrayal and a trigger for great innovation. Writing with the same exuberant wit and psychological insight that earned him a Pulitzer Prize for art criticism, Sebastian Smee explores here the way that coming into one&#x2019;s own as an artist&#x2014;finding one&#x2019;s voice&#x2014;almost always involves willfully breaking away from some intimate&#x2019;s expectations of who you are or ought to be.<br><br><b>Praise for&nbsp;<i>The Art of Rivalry</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Gripping . . . Mr. Smee&#x2019;s skills as a critic are evident throughout.

Or it was: It disappeared from the walls of a German museum in 1988 and hasn&#x2019;t been seen since.<br><br>It showed Bacon head-�on and from very close in. &#x201c;Everyone thought of him as a blur,&#x201d; Freud would later say, &#x201c;but he had a very specific face. I remember wanting to bring Bacon out from behind the blur.&#x201d;<br><br>In the finished picture, Bacon&#x2019;s famously jowly cheeks expand to fill the frame, and his ears almost touch the edges. His eyes are cast down&#x2014;�though not to the floor. They have a pensive, faraway look, a suggestion of inward retreat. It is an elusive but unforgettable expression, one that combines self-�mourning with a strange hint of inner fury.<br><br>Freud went on to achieve worldwide renown for the fleshy amplitude of his pictures and for his use of thick, oily paint, lavishly applied. But in 1952, when he painted Bacon, his style was very different. He specialized in surface tension. Working on a small scale, he kept the paint as smooth as possible&#x2014;�no visible brushstrokes. Control was paramount. So was an evenness of attention, fastidiously maintained across the entire surface of his pictures.<br><br>Even so, the contrast between the left and right sides of Bacon&#x2019;s distinctive, pear-�shaped head is odd&#x2014;�and becomes more remarkable the longer you study it. The right (Bacon&#x2019;s right), cast lightly in shadow, is a study in placidity. Over on the left, however, everything is slipping and skidding about. An S-�shaped lick of hair&#x2014;�you can count the strands&#x2014;�casts a dashing shadow on Bacon&#x2019;s brow. The whole left side of his mouth twists upward, triggering a pouchy swelling, like the body&#x2019;s response to a sting, at the corner of his mouth. A sheen of sweat shines from that side of his nose. Even the left ear seems to convulse and squirm. Most striking of all is the way Bacon&#x2019;s left eyebrow extends its powerful arabesque into the furrow at the center of his forehead. This has nothing to do with &#x201c;realism&#x201d; if you take that term literally; no eyebrow behaves this way. But it&#x2019;s the engine that powers the whole portrait, �just as the portrait itself is the key to the story of the most interesting, fertile&#x2014;�and volatile&#x2014;�relationship in British art of the twentieth century.<br><br>In 1987, thirty-�five years after it was painted, and just months before it disappeared, this tiny picture was sent to Washington, DC. If it hadn&#x2019;t been painted on copper, one could have put a stamp and address on the back and sent it as a postcard. Instead, it was carefully packaged and crated and sent along with eighty-�one other works to the US capital. It was to be part of a Freud retrospective, organized by Andrea Rose of the British Council, at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, situated on the National Mall.<br><br>Despite its size, the portrait of Bacon was one of the show&#x2019;s most charismatic objects. It helped, undoubtedly, that the subject himself was famous. Bacon, who was still alive at the time (he died in 1992), was a far better-�known artist than Freud himself. Since the 1960s, major exhibitions of his work had been mounted not only in London, where he lived, but also in places like the Grand Palais in Paris and the Guggenheim and Metropolitan museums in New York. No British artist of the twentieth century had received more sustained critical acclaim. None had plumbed the darker recesses of the popular imagination with a body of work so bold and broadly influential. Bacon was a bona fide international star.<br><br>Freud was a different kind of artist. He was, as the critic John Russell described him, &#x201c;a worrisome and disquieting presence&#x201d;&#x2014;�stubborn, perverse, hardworking, immune to fashion. He had exhibited regularly from his early twenties all the way into his sixties (he was now sixty-�six), and was enough of a presence in England to be made a Companion of Honour in 1985. But outside the British Isles, he barely registered. And in the United States he was quite unknown.<br><br>Less audacious (at least ostensibly) than Bacon&#x2019;s work, Freud&#x2019;s also appeared more conventional in its fidelity to appearances. His kind of painting&#x2014;�figurative, objective, anchored in observation&#x2014;�had been out of fashion for almost a century. His clearest predecessors were not Pollock and de Kooning (the Dutch-�born American painter with whom Bacon was most often compared), much less Duchamp and Warhol, the dominant influences on artists in the 1970s and early &#x2019;80s. They were nineteenth-�century painters such as Courbet, Manet, and especially Degas.<br><br>His work, what&#x2019;s more, was ugly. His manner of painting&#x2014;�unflinching realism, prolonged scrutiny, a beady-�eyed focus on humid, blotched skin and sagging flesh&#x2014;�was a turnoff. It was raw and rash-�ridden. Sweaty. You could almost smell it. It certainly didn&#x2019;t fit with the American museum world&#x2019;s notion of advanced art, which, since the 1960s, had tended to be minimal, abstract, conceptual, and altogether more hygienic.<br><br>And yet, for all Freud&#x2019;s peculiarity&#x2014;�for all the sense that he was some kind of throwback&#x2014;�a growing number of people in Britain (critics, dealers, fellow artists) had come to feel that he was nearing the height of his powers as an artist. For the best part of two decades, he had been producing paintings of such visceral impact, such sustained intensity and conviction, that although they did not fit into any obvious category or narrative of contemporary art, they were impossible to dismiss.<br><br>Keen, then, to extend his reputation beyond the UK, the British Council had organized an exhibition of Freud&#x2019;s work they could send abroad. Organizers at the British Council selected the works and negotiated the loans (most of Freud&#x2019;s works were in private collections). They produced a handsome catalog, too, with an insightful introductory essay by Robert Hughes, the influential Time magazine art critic. Hughes homed in on Freud&#x2019;s portrait of Bacon in the essay&#x2019;s very first sentence. The portrait&#x2019;s even light, he wrote, had &#x201c;something Flemish&#x201d; about it; its size conjured the Gothic world of the &#x201c;miniature&#x201d;; it was &#x201c;tight, exact, meticulous and (most eccentrically, when seen in the late fifties, a time of urgent gestures on burlap), it was painted on copper.&#x201d; But what made the picture truly mesmerizing, stressed Hughes, was that it was also uncannily modern. Freud &#x201c;had caught a kind of visual truth,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;at once sharply focused and evasively inward, that rarely showed itself in painting before the twentieth century.&#x201d; He had somehow given Bacon&#x2019;s &#x201c;pear-�shaped face the silent intensity of a grenade in the millisecond before it goes off.&#x201d;<br><br>The British Council secured venues for the show in Paris, London, and Berlin. But they had trouble finding a US venue. Freud wasn&#x2019;t well enough known, American museum curators claimed. His fleshy, indecorous work would be disconcerting to the general public. He was too British, too old-�school, too real. The American curator Michael Auping later recalled the general consensus: Confronting Freud&#x2019;s work in the context of American postwar avant-�garde art, he wrote, was &#x201c;like discovering pungent moulds on the pristine white walls of the museum.&#x201d;<br><br>But the British Council wouldn&#x2019;t give up. They contacted James Demetrion, the director of the Hirshhorn, part of the family of museums in Washington, DC, operated by the Smithsonian Institution. They explained the predicament. Demetrion listened. He was surprised, he later recalled, that no New York museum was interested. &#x201c;Apparently Freud was not well-�known outside of Britain, which kind of baffled me,&#x201d; he said. He agreed to take the show. And his decision turned out to be a coup, not only for himself and the Hirshhorn, but&#x2014;�in a major way&#x2014;�for Freud.<br><br>The show opened at the Hirshhorn&#x2014;�the first of four international venues&#x2014;�on September 15, 1987. Freud would be turning seventy in five years. And yet this was the first major representation of his work outside Great Britain.<br><br>Against all expectations, it turned into a blockbuster. Strong reviews in major newspapers, weekly magazines, and art journals up and down the eastern seaboard, along with Hughes&#x2019;s essay (which was published independently in The New York Review of Books), and a profile in The New York Times Magazine, all helped promote it as a major, galvanizing event. Freud&#x2019;s career took off. Before long, he had dropped his English dealer and was selling his works exclusively through two prestigious New York galleries. And within ten years, he was being acclaimed as the most famous living painter not just in Britain but, arguably, in the world. In May 2008, one of his paintings, Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, became the most expensive work by a living artist, selling to the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for $33.6 million. (Another painting of the same subject, Sue Tilley, sold for $56.2 million in 2015.)<br><br>After its spell at the Hirshhorn, the exhibition left the United States for stints at prominent museums in Paris and London. Its final stop was in Berlin, where it opened at the end of April 1988. The venue, here in the city where Freud was born and grew up, was the Neue Nationalgalerie. Other museums in Germany had expressed interest in taking the show, and had been willing to meet all the costs, but Freud, according to Andrea Rose, &#x201c;wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it.&#x201d; He insisted that the show be held in Berlin&#x2014;�or not in Germany at all. Unfortunately, the Neue Nationalgalerie was reluctant to get involved. They refused to meet the majority of the exhibition costs, remained aloof from the production of the catalog, and sent no one to see the exhibition in Washington, DC, Paris, or London. Worried about the show&#x2019;s reception in Germany, Rose had to insist that their curator come to London while the show was on at the Hayward. It was only then, she recalled, &#x201c;that they realized that the show was much bigger than they had anticipated, and had to reconfigure the galleries to accommodate it.&#x201d; (They had originally designated the museum&#x2019;s graphics gallery for the show&#x2014;�about a quarter of the size needed.)<br><br>A glass-�and-�steel building&#x2014;�the last completed commission of the legendary modernist architect Mies van der Rohe&#x2014;�the Neue Nationalgalerie is situated in a vast, leafy culture precinct studded with museums, concert halls, science centers, and libraries. The Tiergarten, Berlin&#x2019;s great park, runs along its northern border, the Landwehr Canal along the south. The actual tiergarten&#x2014;�the zoo&#x2014;�is situated to the west of the museum, with Potsdamer Platz less than a ten-�minute walk away to the east.<br><br>Until he was eight and moved to England, Freud had lived in two successive apartments in this neighborhood. He used to play in the Tiergarten as a boy, and once fell through the ice while skating there (&#x201c;It was very exciting,&#x201d; he later recalled). He used to swap cigarette cards with dealers around Potsdamer Platz: &#x201c;You could swap three Marlene Dietrichs for one Johnny Weissmuller, that kind of thing,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Freud&#x2019;s family had been forced to flee Germany when Hitler rose to power. Freud had had the chance to see the dictator only once, in the very square where Freud&#x2019;s family lived, right across from where the Neue Nationalgalerie now is. &#x201c;He had huge people on either side of him,&#x201d; he recalled; &#x201c;he was tiny.&#x201d;<br><br>Freud&#x2019;s show opened on April 29, 1988. The Berlin Wall was still a year from falling, the city still divided. The exhibition was reviewed very well in the West German newspapers and art press, and the catalog sold out within the first few weeks. If the response was not as momentous as it had been in the United States, the welcome afforded this long-�lost son of Berlin was nonetheless sincere and appreciative. Attendances were higher than expected.<br><br>But a month after the opening&#x2014;�it was a Friday, late in the afternoon&#x2014;�a visitor to the museum noticed something awry. Right near the beginning of the Freud exhibition, the part that showed works from the early part of his career, there was an empty space on the wall where it was quite clear there should have been a painting. This was startling. But who should be notified? Security at the museum at that time was slack to the point of invisibility. There hadn&#x2019;t been a single guard on duty in the exhibition between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m., according to one report. The portrait was so small that it would have been easy to slip it into an inside coat pocket and proceed out of the exhibition without anyone noticing.<br><br>The visitor found a member of the museum&#x2019;s staff and reported the missing painting. The news went swiftly up the chain of command. The police were called. They sealed the building and systematically questioned and searched every visitor still inside the museum.<br><br>But it was all to no avail. Gradually, it dawned on everyone&#x2014;�museum staff and police alike&#x2014;�that they were too late. The thief, or thieves, had slipped through the net. Or more likely, they had left the scene before the net was even in place.<br><br>The Neue Nationalgalerie&#x2019;s director, Dieter Honisch, was deeply embarrassed, as were his staff. Nonetheless, they wanted to keep the show open until the scheduled finishing date, still three weeks off. Freud and the British Council organizers wouldn&#x2019;t have it. There was lobbying from those on the German side&#x2014;�and also from the British ambassador to Germany&#x2014;�to keep it open; but when Freud threatened to ask all the show&#x2019;s private lenders to withdraw their works, they relented, and the show was shut down.<br><br>It was agreed with the police and the British Council organizers that a small reward should be offered. Ports and airports were alerted. A couple of tip-�offs were pursued. But none of it panned out.<br><br>There was nothing about the theft to suggest the work of organized professionals. There had been no break-�in, no weapons, no speedy getaway. The crime seemed basically opportunistic. But neither was it the work of bungling amateurs. The painting had not been yanked from its fittings. The thief had had to use a tool, presumably a screwdriver, to remove the mirror plates fastening the frame to the wall. This suggested a certain amount of premeditation. But if the crime had been planned, it was strange that no ransom demand ever materialized, as often happens in such cases.<br><br>Then again, just as often it doesn&#x2019;t. The whole affair was mystifying.<br><br>One thing was widely noted. When the picture was stolen, the museum had been filled with students. In Germany, as elsewhere, the portrait&#x2019;s subject, Francis Bacon, was hugely admired. One of modern art&#x2019;s most vivid personalities, he had, among young people in particular, what amounted to a cult following. He was certainly more popular than Freud, who was still to most Germans&#x2014;�even art lovers&#x2014;�a stranger. Only his family name (he was the grandson of Sigmund Freud) was familiar. So perhaps it was one of the students who stole it&#x2014;�or several �working together . . . ? When Robert Hughes tried to console Freud with the thought that the theft was a perverse kind of compliment&#x2014;�someone, he offered, had evidently loved his painting enough to steal it&#x2014;�Freud demurred. &#x201c;Oh, d&#x2019;you think so?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I agree. I think somebody out there really loves Francis.&#x201d;</p><h2>St. Therese of the Child Jesus</h2><p>This full-color illustrated children's book relates many aspects&nbsp;of St. Therese's life.</p><p></p><h2>Grifters (Mulholland Classic)</h2><p>To his friends, to his coworkers, and even to his mistress Moira, Roy Dillon is an honest hardworking salesman.

The Black Poets was the quintessential book I&#x2019;d see on the shelves of my fellow Black writer friends. If you were into literature, especially poetry, as an African American, then you had to have this book. It verified your commitment to the cause and for the culture. If you don&#x2019;t have it, why not? How will you learn about those who came before us? Where we&#x2019;re going and where we&#x2019;ve been? No shade, but I have my copy. Whether I got the book soon after coming into the world or not, I cannot say.<br> <br>There are other seminal anthologies used for study and inspiration, such as The Scribner Anthology of Contemporary Short Fiction or E. Lynn Harris and Marita Golden&#x2019;s Gumbo, a celebration of African American voices. I&#x2019;d like to think that Everyday People: The Color of Life&#x2014;A Short Story Anthology will be that type of book over time. On shelves not only for reference but for pleasure, a book housing short fiction from an array of wonderful contemporary writers both established and emerging that speaks to experience, loss, fulfillment, and also being at that fork in the road where decisions must be made yet are not always pursued due to failings of moral fortitude. Each story will always speak to our humanity and the universality of who we are as People of Color/Indigenous People.<br> <br>As I told the contributors when I approached them, Everyday People isn&#x2019;t &#x201c;my baby&#x201d; in terms of inception. This book was birthed through the ingenuity and enthusiasm of the late Brook Stephenson, a wonderful person and literary citizen who loved books as much if not even more than I do. He wanted to see a new collection celebrate PoC voices. The aim here is to continue what other writers have cobbled together of not only Black voices but Asian/Pacific Islander, Indigenous, and Latinx ones as well. At a time when &#x201c;diversity&#x201d; is used as a buzzword, Brook sought to invest in the stories that people may not be seeing. The name of this anthology is not meant to solely focus on the racial composition of the writers or characters but to showcase the larger story and relationships depicted as well as the landscape&#x2014;be it in New York City, Maine, Alabama, Great Britain, South Korea, Ghana, or Sri Lanka. As the Sly &amp; the Family Stone song of the same name goes &#x201c;I am no better and neither are you / We are the same whatever we do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>I inherited this anthology after Brook passed away suddenly and Atria was gung ho about seeing it come to fruition. From there I solicited and corresponded with contributors during a very tense time (the 2016 US presidential election). I was heartened by how eagerly those I reached out to wanted to add their names and fiction in any way they could, or even offer a hand after the fact. In 2017, I found that reading their submissions reinvigorated me with the power of the written word when things seemed bleak.

These stories, mostly new and some republished, pack a punch in all their iterations, leaving me sated knowing that the world will have a chance to also engage with these characters and writers.

Get up, Will Henry, and be quick about it!&#x201d; he said urgently. &#x201c;We have a caller!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A caller?&#x201d; I murmured in reply. &#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A little after one. Now get dressed and meet me at the back door. Step lively, Will Henry, and snap to!&#x201d;<br> <br>He withdrew from my little alcove, taking the light with him. I dressed in the dark and scampered down the ladder in my stocking feet, putting on the last of my garments, a soft felt hat a size too small for my twelve-year-old head. That little hat was all I had left from my life before coming to live with him, and so it was precious to me.<br> <br>He had lit the jets along the hall of the upper floor, though but a single light burned on the main floor, in the kitchen at the rear of the old house where just the two of us lived, without so much as a maid to pick up after us: The doctor was a private man, engaged in a dark and dangerous business, and could ill afford the prying eyes and gossiping tongue of the servant class. When the dust and dirt became intolerable, about every three months or so, he would press a rag and a bucket into my hands and tell me to &#x201c;snap to&#x201d; before the tide of filth overwhelmed us.<br> <br>I followed the light into the kitchen, my shoes completely forgotten in my trepidation. This was not the first nocturnal visitor since my coming to live with him the year before. The doctor had numerous visits in the wee hours of the morning, more than I cared to remember, and none were cheerful social calls. His business was dangerous and dark, as I have said, and so, on the whole, were his callers.<br> <br>The one who called on this night was standing just outside the back door, a gangly, skeletal figure, his shadow rising wraithlike from the glistening cobblestones. His face was hidden beneath the broad brim of his straw hat, but I could see his gnarled knuckles protruding from his frayed sleeves, and knobby yellow ankles the size of apples below his tattered trousers. Behind the old man a broken-down nag of a horse stamped and snorted, steam rising from its quivering flanks. Behind the horse, barely visible in the mist, was the cart with its grotesque cargo, wrapped in several layers of burlap.<br> <br>The doctor was speaking quietly to the old man as I came to the door, a comforting hand upon his shoulder, for clearly our caller was nearly mad with panic. He had done the right thing, the doctor was assuring him. He, the doctor, would take the matter from here. All would be well. The poor old soul nodded his large head, which appeared all the larger with its lid of straw as it bobbed on its spindly neck.<br> <br>&#x201c;&nbsp;&#x2019;Tis a crime. A bloody crime of nature!&#x201d; he exclaimed at one point. &#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t have taken it; I should have covered it back up and left it to the mercy of God!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I take no stances on theology, Erasmus,&#x201d; said the doctor. &#x201c;I am a scientist. But is it not said that we are his instruments? If that is the case, then God brought you to her and directed you hence to my door.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you won&#x2019;t report me?&#x201d; the old man asked, with a sideways glance toward the doctor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your secret will be as safe with me as I hope mine will be with you. Ah, here is Will Henry. Will Henry, where are your shoes? No, no,&#x201d; he said as I turned to fetch them. &#x201c;I need you to ready the laboratory.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, doctor,&#x201d; I responded dutifully, and turned to go a second time.<br> <br>&#x201c;And put a pot on. It&#x2019;s going to be a long night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; I said. I turned a third time.<br> <br>&#x201c;And find my boots, Will Henry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hesitated, waiting for a fourth command. The old man called Erasmus was staring at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, what are you waiting for?&#x201d; the doctor said. &#x201c;Snap to, Will Henry!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Right away, sir!&#x201d;<br> <br>I left them in the alley, hearing the old man ask as I hurried across the kitchen, &#x201c;He is your boy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He is my assistant,&#x201d; came the doctor&#x2019;s reply.<br> <br>I set the water on to boil and then went down to the basement. I lit the lamps, laid out the instruments. (I wasn&#x2019;t sure which he might need, but had a strong suspicion the old man&#x2019;s delivery was not alive&#x2014;I had heard no sounds coming from the old cart, and there didn&#x2019;t seem to be great urgency to fetch the cargo inside&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though this may have been more hope than suspicion.) Then I removed a fresh smock from the closet and rummaged under the stairs for the doctor&#x2019;s rubber boots. They weren&#x2019;t there, and for a moment I stood by the examination table in mute panic. I had washed them the week before and was certain I had placed them under the stairs. Where were the doctor&#x2019;s boots? From the kitchen came the clumping of the men&#x2019;s tread across the wooden floor. He was coming, and I had lost his boots!<br> <br>I spied the boots just as the doctor and Erasmus began to descend the stairs. They were beneath the worktable, where I had placed them. Why had I put them there? I set them by the stool and waited, my heart pounding, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps. The basement was very cold, at least ten degrees colder than the rest of the house, and stayed that way year round.<br> <br>The load, still wrapped tightly in burlap, must have been heavy: The muscles in the men&#x2019;s necks bulged with the effort, and their descent was painfully slow. Once the old man cried for a halt. They paused five steps from the bottom, and I could see the doctor was annoyed at this delay. He was anxious to unveil his new prize.<br> <br>They eventually heaved their burden onto the examining table. The doctor guided the old man to the stool. Erasmus sank down upon it, removed his straw hat, and wiped his crinkled brow with a filthy rag. He was shaking badly. In the light I could see that nearly all of him was filthy, from his mud-encrusted shoes to his broken fingernails to the fine lines and crevasses of his ancient face. I could smell the rich, loamy aroma of damp earth rising from him.<br> <br>&#x201c;A crime,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;A crime!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, grave-robbing is a crime,&#x201d; said the doctor. &#x201c;A very serious crime, Erasmus. A thousand-dollar fine and five years&#x2019; hard labor.&#x201d; He shrugged into his smock and motioned for his boots. He leaned against the banister to tug them on. &#x201c;We are coconspirators now. I must trust you, and you in turn must trust me. Will Henry, where is my tea?&#x201d;<br> <br>I raced up the stairs. Below, the old man was saying, &#x201c;I have a family to feed. My wife, she&#x2019;s very ill; she needs medicine. I can&#x2019;t find work, and what use is gold and jewels to the dead?&#x201d;<br> <br>They had left the back door ajar. I swung it closed and threw the bolt, but not until I checked the alley. I saw nothing but the fog, which had grown thicker, and the horse, its face dominated by its large eyes that seemed to implore me for help.<br> <br>I could hear the rise and fall of the voices in the basement as I prepared the tea, Erasmus&#x2019;s with its high-pitched, semi-hysterical edge, the doctor&#x2019;s measured and low, beneath which lurked an impatient curtness no doubt born of his eagerness to unwrap the old man&#x2019;s unholy bundle. My unshod feet had grown quite cold, but I tried my best to ignore the discomfort. I dressed the tray with sugar and cream and two cups. Though the doctor hadn&#x2019;t ordered the second, I thought the old man might need a cup to repair his shattered nerves.<br> <br>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. halfway to it, the ground just gave beneath me,&#x201d; the old grave-robber was saying as I descended with the tray. &#x201c;As if I struck a hollow or pocket in the earth. I fell face-first upon the top of the casket. Don&#x2019;t know if my fall cracked the lid or if it was cracked by the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cracked before I fell.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Before, no doubt,&#x201d; said the doctor.<br> <br>They were as I had left them, the doctor leaning against the banister, the old man shivering upon the stool. I offered him some tea, and he accepted the proffered cup gladly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I am chilled to my very bones!&#x201d; he whimpered.<br> <br>&#x201c;This has been a cold spring,&#x201d; the doctor observed. He struck me as at once bored and agitated.<br> <br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t just leave it there,&#x201d; the old man explained. &#x201c;Cover it up again and leave it? No, no. I&#x2019;ve more respect than that. I fear God. I fear the judgment of eternity! A crime, Doctor. An abomination! So once I gathered my wits, I used the horse and a bit of rope to haul them from the hole, wrapped them up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. brought them here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You did the right thing, Erasmus.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;&nbsp;&#x2018;There&#x2019;s but one man who&#x2019;ll know what to do,&#x2019; I said to myself. Forgive me, but you must know what they say about you and the curious goings-on in this house. Only the deaf would not know about Pellinore Warthrop and the house on Harrington Lane!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I am fortunate,&#x201d; said the doctor dryly, &#x201c;that you are not deaf.&#x201d;<br> <br>He went to the old man&#x2019;s side and placed both hands on his shoulders.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have my confidence, Erasmus Gray. As I&#x2019;m certain I have yours. I will speak to no one of your involvement in this &#x2018;crime,&#x2019; as you call it, as I&#x2019;m sure you will keep mum regarding mine. Now, for your trouble&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> <br>He produced a wad of bills from his pocket and stuffed them into the old man&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to rush you off, but each moment you stay endangers both you and my work, both of which matter a great deal to me, though one perhaps a bit more than the other,&#x201d; he added with a tight smile. He turned to me. &#x201c;Will Henry, show our caller to the door.&#x201d; Then he turned back to Erasmus Gray. &#x201c;You have done an invaluable service to the advancement of science, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>The old man seemed more interested in the advancement of his fortunes, for he was staring openmouthed at the cash in his still-quivering hands. Dr. Warthrop urged him to his feet and toward the stairs, instructing me not to forget to lock the back door and find my shoes.<br> <br>&#x201c;And don&#x2019;t lollygag, Will Henry. We&#x2019;ve work to last us the rest of the night. Snap to!&#x201d;<br> <br>Old Erasmus hesitated at the back door, a dirty paw upon my shoulder, the other clutching his tattered straw hat, his rheumy eyes straining against the fog, which had now completely engulfed his horse and cart. Its snorts and stamping against the stones were the only evidence of the beast&#x2019;s existence.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you here, boy?&#x201d; he asked suddenly, giving my shoulder a hard squeeze. &#x201c;This is no business for children.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My parents died in a fire, sir,&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;The doctor took me in.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The doctor,&#x201d; Erasmus echoed. &#x201c;They call him that&#x2014;but what exactly is he a doctor of?&#x201d;<br> <br>The grotesque, I might have answered. The bizarre. The unspeakable. Instead I gave the same answer the doctor had given me when I&#x2019;d asked him not long after my arrival at the house on Harrington Lane. &#x201c;Philosophy,&#x201d; I said with little conviction.<br> <br>&#x201c;Philosophy!&#x201d; Erasmus cried softly. &#x201c;Not what I would call it, that be certain!&#x201d;<br> <br>He jammed the hat upon his head and plunged into the fog, shuffling forward until it engulfed him.<br> <br>A few minutes later I was descending the stairs to the basement laboratory, having thrown the bolt to the door and having found my shoes, after a moment or two of frantic searching, exactly where I had left them the night before. The doctor was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs, impatiently drumming his fingers upon the rail. Apparently he did not think there was enough &#x201c;snap&#x201d; in my &#x201c;to.&#x201d; As for myself, I was not looking forward to the rest of the evening. This was not the first time someone had called at our back door in the middle of the night bearing macabre packages, though this certainly was the largest since I had come to live with the doctor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you lock the door?&#x201d; the doctor asked. I noticed again the color high in his cheeks, the slight shortness of breath, the excited quaver in his voice. I answered that I had. He nodded. &#x201c;If what he says is true, Will Henry, if I have not been taken for a fool&#x2014;which would not be the first time&#x2014;then this is an extraordinary find. Come!&#x201d;<br> <br>We took our positions, he by the table where lay the bundle of muddy burlap, I behind him and to his right, manning the tall rolling tray of instruments, with pencil and notebook at the ready. My hand was shaking slightly as I wrote the date across the top of the page, April 15, 1888.<br> <br>He donned his gloves with a loud pop! against his wrists and stamped his boots on the cold stone floor. He pulled on his mask, leaving just the top of his nose and his intense dark eyes exposed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are we ready, Will Henry?&#x201d; he breathed, his voice muffled by the mask. He drummed his fingers in the empty air.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ready, sir,&#x201d; I replied, though I felt anything but.<br> <br>&#x201c;Scissors!&#x201d;<br> <br>I slapped the instrument handle-first into his open palm.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, the big ones, Will Henry. The shears there.&#x201d;<br> <br>He began at the narrow end of the bundle, where the feet must have been, cutting down the center of the thick material, his shoulders hunched, the muscles of his jaw bunching with the effort. He paused once to stretch and loosen his cramping fingers, then returned to the task. The burlap was wet and caked with mud.<br> <br>&#x201c;The old man trussed it tighter than a Christmas turkey,&#x201d; the doctor muttered.<br> <br>After what seemed like hours, he reached the opposite end. The burlap had parted an inch or two along the cut, but no more. The contents remained a mystery and would remain so for a few more seconds. The doctor handed me the shears and leaned against the table, resting before the final, awful climax. At last he straightened, pressing his hands upon the small of his back. He took a deep breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;Very well, then,&#x201d; he said softly. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have it, Will Henry.&#x201d;<br> <br>He peeled away the material, working it apart in the same direction as he had cut it. The burlap fell back on either side, draping over the table like the petals of a flower opening to welcome the spring sun.<br> <br>Over his bent back I could see them. Not the single corpulent corpse that I had anticipated, but two bodies, one wrapped about the other in an obscene embrace. I choked back the bile that rushed from my empty stomach, and willed my knees to be still. Remember, I was twelve years old. A boy, yes, but a boy who had already seen his fair share of grotesqueries. The laboratory had shelves along the walls that held large jars wherein oddities floated in preserving solution, extremities and organs of creatures that you would not recognize, that you would swear belonged to the world of nightmares, not our waking world of comfortable familiarity. And, as I&#x2019;ve said, this was not the first time I had assisted the doctor at his table.<br> <br>But nothing had prepared me for what the old man delivered that night. I daresay your average adult would have fled the room in horror, run screaming up the stairs and out of the house, for what lay within that burlap cocoon laid shame to all the platitudes and promises from a thousand pulpits upon the nature of a just and loving God, of a balanced and kind universe, and the dignity of man.

On the road I had to hide under a truck to avoid soldiers who were coming my way. For twenty minutes I lay there in utter fear watching their boots walk back and forth in front of the truck. My heart was pounding so fast and loud that I was afraid one of the soldiers would hear it and I would be killed instantly.To calm myself, I started begging God to take mercyon me and save me from these men and their guns. I remembered the words of my mother after Israeli soldiers beat my father. She told us to put our fear and anger aside and pray for the poor soldiers, who were also afraid because they were away from their homes in Israel.I began to feel bad for the soldiers. I wondered: Where do they sleep and are they afraid of little children like me? What kind of food do they eat? Do they have big or small families? Their voices began to remind me of my neighbors. My fear dissipated a bit as I pictured the soldiers as people I knew. Although my twenty minutes under the truck seemed like an eternity, I believe that shedding my fear literally saved my life.Thirty- six years later I look around and see another kind of devastation created by fear. I saw the collapse of my city, Detroit, when so many white people ?ed the city out of fear. After 9/11, the Arab and Muslim communities segregated themselves because of the level of suspicion directed at them from others. Fear of association because of ethnicity led many to retreat within themselves and their community. They stopped socializing with non- Arab/ Muslim colleagues and neighbors. Once again, we allow differences to separate us because of fear.When I was hiding under that truck, if my terror had made me lose control and I had started to cry, the jittery soldiers might have pulled the trigger because of their own fears. Thank God I lived to wonder about this. I understood as a child that fear can be deadly.I believe it is fear we should be ?ghting, not the &#x201c;other.&#x201d; We all belong to the same human tribe; that kinship supersedes our differences. We are all soldiers patrolling the road, and we&#x2019;re all little children hiding under the truck.Terry Ahwal was born in the West Bank city of Ramallah, and now lives with her family near Detroit. She is development director for the Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan, and teaches classes in nonviolent communication at Madonna University. Ahwal said her husband&#x2019;s family is Jewish and that Thanksgiving in their house hold is a mix of Jews and Arabs coming together with no uneasiness.<br>Excerpted from This I Believe II by Jay Allison.<br>Copyright � 2009 by by Jay Allison.<br>Published in July 2009 by Henry Holt and Company.<br>All rights reserved.

Maxwell, author, speaker, and founder of the INJOY Group</p></p><p>I originally wrote The Top Ten Mistakes Leaders Make in the early 1990s. I had just turned forty and was relatively young in my leadership experience as a new CEO. The success of this book over the years has been encouraging, especially since most books by unknown authors never go into a second printing. I have heard from so many readers who could empathize with the issues I brought up. Most of the people I hear from suffer in some way under leaders who still don't get it: the servant collab- orative leadership style. They write to say thank you for giving them hope and new ideas of how to do leadership right. With all that has been writ- ten about empowering leadership styles, my observation still holds true that it is not a natural part of human nature. Unless leaders are out there learning and opening themselves to different ideas on how to lead, most will continue to default toward top-down leadership.&nbsp;<b>Dr. Hans Finzel </b>is a successful author, teacher and leader among leaders.

Born in 1918, L'Engle grew up in New York City, Switzerland, South Carolina and Massachusetts. Her father was a reporter and her mother had studied to be a pianist, and their house was always full of musicians and theater people. L'Engle graduated cum laude from Smith College, then returned to New York to work in the theater. While touring with a play, she wrote her first book, <i>The Small Rain</i>, originally published in 1945. She met her future husband, Hugh Franklin, when they both appeared in <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>. </p><p>Upon becoming Mrs. Franklin, L'Engle gave up the stage in favor of the typewriter. In the years her three children were growing up, she wrote four more novels. Hugh Franklin temporarily retired from the theater, and the family moved to western Connecticut and for ten years ran a general store. Her book <i>Meet the Austins</i>, an American Library Association Notable Children's Book of 1960, was based on this experience. </p><p>Her science fantasy classic <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> was awarded the 1963 Newbery Medal. Two companion novels, <i>A Wind in the Door</i> and <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet</i> (a Newbery Honor book), complete what has come to be known as The Time Trilogy, a series that continues to grow in popularity with a new generation of readers. Her 1980 book <i>A Ring of Endless Light</i> won the Newbery Honor.

A nice way for preschoolers to see tantrum behavior from a different perspective without the message feeling forced." - Seira Wilson, Amazon Editor<br><br>Nilson and Amelia do everything together. But if one little thing goes wrong, Nilson throws the biggest, most house shaking-est fit ever! Amelia helps Nilson control his gorilla-sized temper by promising him banana ice cream and letting him play with her froggy coin purse. But, sometimes, Amelia needs to be calmed down, too.<br><br>Inspired by Ohora's own "negotiations" with his two sons, <i>No Fits, Nilson!</i> is a hilarious preschool pick for kids and parents navigating the treacherous tantrum phase.</p><p>Zachariah Ohora is the author of <i>Stop Snoring, Bernard</i>, for which he received the Society of Illustrators Founder&#x2019;s Award, and his work has appeared in numerous publications, including <i>The New York Times</i>. He lives in Narberth, PA, with his wife and their two sons.PreS-Gr 1-Amelia's constant companion is a giant teal-colored gorilla. She and Nilson play well together, but he occasionally gets frustrated or angry, causing him to throw tantrums. Whenever he threatens to lose his cool, Amelia is there to soothe him by saying, "No fits, Nilson" and offer a pleasant alternative. But sometimes, she needs calming, too. Nilson quells the little girl's temper by letting her take the last banana ice-cream cone while he partakes of the chocolate one instead. Parents will not be surprised to discover in the last picture that Nilson is really a reasonably sized stuffed animal that Amelia uses as a coping tool. The matte illustrations are done in a vibrant palette and give the book an old-fashioned look. Nilson hulks over petite Amelia, but his fierce demeanor is balanced by a heart-shaped patch of tummy fur and a childlike choice of accessories. The simple text set against lots of white space makes this a good read-aloud. Many children will readily identify with this not-too-scary gorilla whose emotions are kept in check by an endearing youngster-or vice versa.-Martha Simpson, Stratford Library Association, CT&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Christians are looking for answers from the Bible regarding how God intends for men and women to relate to one another. In this concise and accessible resource, well-known authors and Bible teachers John Piper and Wayne Grudem respond to fifty crucial questions often asked in relation to biblical manhood and womanhood. Answering objections raised against the view that God created men and women equal in value but distinct in role, Piper and Grudem winsomely present a biblical vision of gender roles that is life-giving and fulfilling for both men and women.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Piper</strong> (DTheol, University of Munich) is the founder and teacher of desiringGod.org&nbsp;and the chancellor of Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary. He served for thirty-three years as the senior pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and is the author of more than fifty books, including <em>Desiring God</em>;&nbsp;<em>Don&#x2019;t Waste Your Life</em>;&nbsp;<em>This Momentary Marriage</em>;&nbsp;<em>A Peculiar Glory</em>;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Reading the Bible Supernaturally</em>.</p><p>Founder and Teacher, desiringGod.org; Chancellor, Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary; author, <em>Desiring God</em></p><br><br><p><strong>Wayne Grudem</strong>&nbsp;(PhD, University of Cambridge; DD, Westminster Theological Seminary) is Distinguished Research Professor of Theology and Biblical Studies at Phoenix Seminary, having previously taught for&nbsp;twenty years at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.

Here you will find answers to key questions in a concise format from two of the evangelical community&#x2019;s finest minds. May God use this book to encourage heartfelt obedience to his good and wise design.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Randy Stinson,</strong> Senior Vice President for Academic Administration and Provost,&nbsp;The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;To borrow a phrase from C. S. Lewis, there&#x2019;s a kind of &#x2018;Deep Magic&#x2019; about the way God created man and woman&#x2015;an ancient wonder that few of us postmoderns appreciate. Through a pragmatic arrangement of <em>50 Crucial Questions</em>, Grudem and Piper bring out passage after passage of Scripture to awaken our minds and hearts to the wonder of what our Creator has done. This concise treatment of the major questions surrounding our roles in the church and home will catapult readers straight into God&#x2019;s Word to see what is really there.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gloria Furman,</strong> author, <em>Missional Motherhood</em> and <em>Treasuring Christ When Your Hands Are Full</em></p><p>&#x201c;The core content of this book was tremendously needed and helpful when it was first published almost a quarter century ago. In our current generation, where there is breathtaking confusion and distortion regarding gender and marriage, it is needed more than ever. There is a desperate need for leaders of the evangelical church to speak with a wise, clear, and uncompromising biblical clarity. Grudem and Piper provide that clear voice, and I pray their answers will be heard and practiced so that God&#x2019;s glory will be more powerfully displayed through his grand design for men and women.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>K.

So the fifth-century historian Herodotus has some Athenians declare, in explanation of why they would never betray their fellow Greeks to the enemy, the "barbarian" Persians. And he might have added further common features, such as clothing, foodways, and political institutions. But if the Greeks knew that they were kin, why did many of them side with the Persians against fellow Greeks, and why, more generally, is ancient Greek history so often the history of internecine wars and other forms of competition with one another? This is the question acclaimed historian Robin Waterfield sets out to explore in this magisterial history of ancient Greece. <br><br>With more information, more engagingly presented, than any similar work, this is the best single-volume account of ancient Greece in more than a generation. Waterfield gives a comprehensive narrative of seven hundred years of history, from the emergence of the Greeks around 750 BCE to the Roman conquest of the last of the Greco-Macedonian kingdoms in 30 BCE. Equal weight is given to all phases of Greek history -- the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods. But history is not just facts; it is also a matter of how we interpret the evidence. Without compromising the readability of the book, Waterfield incorporates the most recent scholarship by classical historians and archaeologists and asks his readers to think critically about Greek history. A brilliant, up-to-date account of ancient Greece, suitable for history buffs and university students alike, <em>Creators, Conquerors, and</em> <em>Citizens</em> presents a compelling and comprehensive story of this remarkable civilization's disunity, underlying cultural solidarity, and eventual political unification.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robin Waterfield </strong>is an independent scholar and translator, living in southern Greece. In addition to more than twenty-five translations of works of Greek literature, he is the author of numerous books, including <em>Dividing the Spoils</em> and <em>Taken at the Flood</em>.<br><br>"The scholarship is thorough, deep, and well-explained... Readers looking for an authoritative account of almost any aspect of ancient Greek history should be thoroughly gratified."--Kirkus <br><p></p><br>"<em>Creators, Conquerors, and Citizens</em> is an ideal seminar on ancient Greek history, in book-form: it's scholarly but never pedantic, and it's all told by a true enthusiast with a gift for clarifying. If Waterfield is correct that every generation needs its own new history of ancient Greece, he's certainly provided a fine example, a book fit to stand alongside Christian Meier's <em>Athens</em> or Josiah Ober's magnificent <em>The Rise and Fall of Classical Greece</em>."--Steve Donoghue, pen Letters Review<p></p><br>"Highly readable, with well-produced maps and figures, it can be relied on as a distillation of twentyfirst-century historians' overall view of the subject... We are in sure hands as Waterfield guides us through the major historical milestones... Any of these would warrant a volume in itself, and the fact that Waterfield keeps the whole huge freight train on track, indeed clacking elegantly along, is proof of an experienced engineer." <br>--Literary Review of Canada<p></p><br>"A distinctive and decidedly modern interpretation of Greek history."--IMHQ Magazine<p></p><br>"Waterfield's searching approach to the nature of Greek identity transforms this otherwise highly traditional, chronological history into something more revelatory... suitably authoritative and measured... wide-ranging, but enlivened by its detail." <br>--Daisy Dunn, <em>Sunday Times</em> [London] <br><p></p><br>"[Waterfield] sets out to trace seven and a half centuries of Greek history (from roughly the first Olympiad to Rome's annexation of Egypt), recognizing the diversity of the Greek diaspora, while explicating many of the social and cultural practices that lent it a degree of unity, and tracing innovations in areas as diverse as philosophy and siege warfare. It is a mark of his skill that he succeeds so brilliantly... This book provides an invaluable resource for anyone wishing a comprehensive account of Greek history and culture, while reading lists point the way for those who wish to find out more. W.'s masterly review of how tensions between cultural unity and political disunity unfolded over eight hundred years is to be thoroughly recommended."--David Stuttard, <em>Classics for All</em> <br><p></p><br>"Waterfield's account is an engaging, sometimes original chronicle... <br>Highly recommended."--<em>CHOICE Reviews</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Calhoun Women: Suzanna &amp; Megan</h2><p>Revisit the unforgettable Calhoun women in these&nbsp;two exceptional stories about love and legend&nbsp;from #1 New York Times bestselling author&nbsp;NORA ROBERTS &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Suzanna's Surrender&nbsp;<br><br>Burned-out and tired as hell, the only thing ex-cop Holt Bradford wanted to do was relax.

Today, there is widespread and growing interest in this branch of homeopathic treatment in the U.S., as evidenced by the inclusion of these twelve cell salts in special displays in health food stores across the country.<br><br>Cell salts (tissue salts) exist in every human body. They are the inorganic biochemical elements found in the blood and tissues. They are the builders and the catalysts for many essential processes. For example, most people have heard of potassium chloride, but probably few realize that it is first and foremost a tissue salt (cell salt) essential to the digestive process. This salt unites with hydrogen to form HCL (hydrochloric acid), aids in the production of bile, serves as an alkalizer, and helps in digestive enzyme formation. Therefore, it is a dynamic component of health.<br><br> Twelve cell salts were identified in the 1850s by European scientists, and this knowledge was soon added to the materia medica of physicians and practitioners throughout Europe. Today, homeopathic practitioners and naturopathic doctors in the United States and other countries are beginning to revive the use of cell salt supplementation in successfully treating a spectrum of disease conditions.<br><br>Much of what has been previously written on cell salts is in somewhat archaic medical language, which is decidedly hard to understand. Mr. Card�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s new book is different. He explains cell salts in a comprehensive fashion, yet simply, and in modern language; gives clear instruction in how to use cell salts, and supplies extensive lists of various disease- or imbalance-conditions that can be helped by cell salt supplementation. A section on the external uses of cell salts, something seldom revealed in the English language, is also included. Finally, the author makes a correspondence between the twelve signs of the zodiac and the use of each of the twelve different cell salts. The book is clearly indexed for ease of usage.</p><p>David R.

The award-winning designer/writer Chip Kidd and photographer Geoff Spear have teamed up to create a book like no other, with an introduction by M. Night Shyamalan, the acclaimed director of <i>Signs</i> and <i>The Sixth Sense</i>. <br><br> Ross has often been called &#x201c;the Norman Rockwell of comics,&#x201d; and this book reveals not only his lifelong love of these classic super heroes but also his vision: Mythology takes you into the studio for a behind-the-scenes look at his fascinating creative process. The combination of Ross&#x2019;s dynamic art and Kidd&#x2019;s kinetic design make images from his most memorable stories&#x2013;including Kingdom Come, Superman: Peace on Earth, Batman: War on Crime, and Uncle Sam&#x2013;soar off the more than 280 pages. There are also hundreds of never-before-seen sketches, limited edition prints, and prototype sculptures. Vintage DC comic panels are interspersed throughout, as reference points from which Ross launches his extraordinary interpretations. <br><br> And most exciting for Ross fans, inside is a DC Comics first: an exclusive, original Superman-Batman story, written by Kidd and painted by Ross. Also included is an all-new origin of Robin, written by Paul Dini. <i>Mythology</i> is a book in which every page explodes with the power of the icons it celebrates.</p><p><b>ALEX ROSS</b> has produced more than 1,500 pages of comics material in less than fourteen years&#x2013;an extraordinary body of work that has earned him every major award in the industry. <br><br> Ross was born in Portland, Oregon, in 1970 and eventually settled in Chicago where he attended the American Academy of Art. Among his best-known books are: <i>Marvels, Kingdom Come, Uncle Sam, Earth X, Superman: Peace on Earth, Batman: War on Crime,</i> and <i>JLA: Liberty and Justice.<br><br></i><b>CHIP KIDD</b> is the author and designer of <i>Batman Collected</i> and <i>Peanuts: The Art of Charles M. Schulz</i>. His book jacket designs for Alfred A. Knopf helped break new ground in the field, from the late 1980s to the present.<i> The Cheese Monkeys,</i> Kidd&#x2019;s first novel, published in 2001, was a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year.<br><br><b>GEOFF SPEAR</b> has photographed for numerous publications, including <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, <i>GQ</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, and the <i>New York Times</i>. His images have also appeared in national ad campaigns for AT&amp;T, American Express, Citibank, and IBM. His photographs for <i>Batman Collected</i> were chosen for the American Photography annual of the best of 1996.With art that looks like a hybrid of Norman Rockwell and Jack Kirby, artist Ross has become the preeminent painter of superheroes of his generation. This lavish coffee- table tribute puts him into a pantheon as exalted as the superbeings he depicts. The son of a preacher and an illustrator, Ross was always captivated by superheroes, but it wasn't until he discovered the use of live models in art school that he was able to realize his visions of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and the rest. Like Rockwell, Ross uses photographs to set up lighting and staging-a process documented in a section at the end of the book-and like Rockwell, he favors otherworldly lighting effects that somehow serve to make his figures more realistic. Like Kirby, he has an innate belief in the iconic power of superheroes that gives them a dimension far beyond the usual four-colored adventures. Whether in Kingdom Come, a renowned tale of the twilight of the superheroes; his own oversized stories written with Paul Dini; or countless posters, covers and commissions, Ross's vision of beings so powerful they verge on arrogant will make viewers glad they don't exist in the real world. Kidd's text is laudatory but never cloying, and the book includes numerous studies, sketches and photos to show Ross's method. While collectors and fans gush over Ross's output, the sheer weight of pictures of every superteam in DC's universe does become somewhat numbing by the end. Still, the immense power of Ross's best images cuts through any clutter, and this volume deftly showcases just that. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

How many will there be? And who will have them? As technology continues to accelerate and machines begin taking care of themselves, fewer people will be necessary. Artificial intelligence is already well on its way to making "good jobs" obsolete: many paralegals, journalists, office workers, and even computer programmers are poised to be replaced by robots and smart software. As progress continues, blue and white collar jobs alike will evaporate, squeezing working- and middle-class families ever further. At the same time, households are under assault from exploding costs, especially from the two major industries-education and health care-that, so far, have not been transformed by information technology. The result could well be massive unemployment and inequality as well as the implosion of the consumer economy itself.<br>The past solutions to technological disruption, especially more training and education, aren't going to work.

His answer to a sharp decline in employment is a guaranteed basic income, a safety net that he suggests would both cushion the effect on the newly unemployable and encourage entrepreneurship among those creative enough to make a new way for themselves.

For too long, argues Jay Timothy Dolmage, disability has been constructed as the antithesis of higher education, often positioned as a distraction, a drain, a problem to be solved. The ethic of higher education encourages students and teachers alike to accentuate ability, valorize perfection, and stigmatize anything that hints at intellectual, mental, or physical weakness, even as we gesture toward the value of diversity and innovation. Examining everything from campus accommodation processes, to architecture, to popular films about college life, Dolmage argues that disability is central to higher education, and that building more inclusive schools allows better education for all.</p></p><p><b>Jay Timothy Dolmage</b> is Associate Professor of English at the University of Waterloo.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>Academic Ableism</i> is a landmark book for higher education.

The book will set fatherless women on the path to growth and fulfillment by helping them to understand how their loss has impacted their lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> A father is supposed to provide a sense of security and stability. Losing a father comes with particular costs that vary depending on the way he left and how old a girl was when she lost him. Drawing on interviews with over 5000 women who became fatherless due to death, divorce, neglect, and outright abandonment, the authors have found that fatherless daughters tend to push their emotions underground.&nbsp; These issues in turn become distinct patterns in their relationships as adult women and they often can't figure out why.

Widge, the orphan-turned-actor, knows that he'll be useful on the trip. Not only does he love the stage, but his knack for a unique shorthand has proven him one of the most valuable apprentices in the troupe. But then a mysterious man appears, claiming to know a secret from Widge's past-a secret that may forever force him from the theatre he loves.<br><br>"An exciting, well-written tale that is sure to leave [readers] clamoring for more." (<i>School Library Journal</i>, starred review)</p><p>Gary L. Blackwood sold his first story when he was nineteen, and has been writing and publishing stories, articles, plays, novels, and nonfiction books regularly ever since. His stage plays have won awards and been produced in university and regional theatre. Nonfiction subjects he's covered include biography, history, and paranormal phenomena. His juvenile novels, which include <i>WILD TIMOTHY, THE DYING SUN</i>, and <i>THE SHAKESPEARE STEALER</i>, are set in a wide range of times and places, from Elizabethan England to a parallel universe. Several have received special recognition and been translated into other languages. He and his wife and kids live outside Carthage, MO.Grade 5-8-In this sequel to The Shakespeare Stealer (Dutton, 1998), Widge has become a "prentice" to the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Will Shakespeare's acting troupe. Besides acting many of the female roles, the youngster uses his skills in "swift writing" to decipher Shakespeare's scribbles and provide individual scripts for each actor. When the plague closes the theatres in London, the players take to the road, but uncooperative company members, brigands, fire, and hostile officials make traveling a challenge. In addition, Widge loses some key roles to an uppity new prentice and wrestles with his emotions as he meets a man who claims to be his father. Through it all, he learns to recognize his own worth and the importance of true friends, and this, of course, is the crux of the story. As with his earlier title, Blackwood has created a vivid portrait of Elizabethan England via wonderful period details, along with plenty of references to the plays and life "upon the wicked stage." The story is extremely well structured, with several interesting subplots; the chapters end at just the right moment, leaving readers eager to plunge ahead. The characters are well developed, with Widge being particularly memorable. The dialogue is realistic, and the humorous plays on words add another level of interest. An exciting, well-written tale that is sure to leave young thespians clamoring for more.<br><i>Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Columbus and the Quest for Jerusalem: How Religion Drove the Voyages that Led to America</h2><p><b>&#x201c;One of the 100 best books of the year.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br> <br><b>Christopher Columbus is reevaluated as a man of deep passion, patience, and religious conviction&#x2014;on a mission to save Jerusalem from Islam.</b><br><br>Five hundred years after he set sail, Columbus is still a controversial figure in history. Debates portray him either as the hero in the great drama of discovery or as an avaricious glory hunter and ruthless destroyer of indigenous cultures. In <i>Columbus and the Quest for Jerusalem</i>, Carol Delaney offers a radically new interpretation of the man and his mission, claiming that the true motivation for his voyages is still widely unknown.<br> <br>Delaney argues that Columbus was inspired to find a western route to the Orient <i>not only </i>to obtain vast sums of gold for the Spanish Crown <i>but primarily </i>to fund a new crusade to take Jerusalem from the Muslims before the end of the world&#x2014;a goal that sustained him until the day he died. Drawing from oft-ignored sources, some from Columbus&#x2019;s own hand, Delaney depicts her subject as a thoughtful interpreter of the native cultures that he and his men encountered, and tells the tragic story of how his initial attempts to establish good relations with the natives turned badly sour. Showing Columbus in the context of his times rather than through the prism of present-day perspectives on colonial conquests reveals a man who was neither a greedy imperialist nor a quixotic adventurer, but a man driven by an abiding religious passion. <i>Columbus and the Quest for Jerusalem </i>is not an apologist&#x2019;s take, but a clear-eyed, thought-provoking, and timely reappraisal of the man and his legacy.</p><p>Carol Delaney received an MTS from Harvard Divinity School and a PhD in Cultural Anthropology from the University of Chicago and is a graduate of Boston University. She was the assistant director of the Center for the Study of World Religions at Harvard, and a visiting professor in the Department of Religious Studies at Brown University. She is now a professor emerita at Stanford University and a research scholar at Brown University.&nbsp;&nbsp;Delaney is the author of several books, including&nbsp;<i>The Seed and the Soil: Gender and Cosmology in Turkish Village Society</i>, <i>Abraham on Trial: The Social Legacy of Biblical Myth</i>,&nbsp;<i>Naturalizing Power: Essays in Feminist Cultural Criticism</i>, and <i>Investigating Culture: An Experiential Introduction to Anthropology</i>.Columbus and the Quest for Jerusalem CHAPTER ONE <br>OMENS OF THE APOCALYPSE<p></p> <br><br> <br>Christopher Columbus was born two years before an event that would change the world and, in large part, would set the course of his life. The fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 was a blow to Christendom from which it has never really recovered. That glorious city&#x2014;home to the Byzantine Empire for more than a thousand years and to Hagia Sophia (Church of the Holy Wisdom), Christendom&#x2019;s most famous church&#x2014;lay in ruins, its emperor dead and its people slain or taken prisoner. When news of the sacking reached Europe, Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, who would become Pope Pius II a few years later, described the fall of the city as &#x201c;the loss of one of the two eyes of the church&#x201d;&#x2014;the other being Rome.1<br> <br>Constantinople had been a major stopping place for pilgrims en route to Jerusalem, primarily because it was the repository for a number of holy relics. Pilgrims yearned for a glimpse of objects like pieces of the True Cross; the remains of Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary; and the bones of Saint Luke, brought back from Jerusalem by Helena, the mother of Constantine I, the founder and first emperor of the eponymous city. Helena, who had made pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 326, had also found the location where Jesus had been buried and had ordered a church, the Holy Sepulchre, to be built on the site.<br> <br>In addition to its religious heritage, Constantinople was also home to European merchants, especially the Genoese who had come to dominate trade with the East through its outposts at ports on the Black Sea. Now, in the mid-fifteenth century, with the fall of Constantinople, the trade route to the East and the pilgrimage route to Jerusalem was virtually closed to the West. Constantinople, like Jerusalem, was in the hands of Muslims. In the struggle between Christianity and Islam, Islam seemed to be winning. Many Christians read this as a sign the end of the world was fast approaching. A pall settled over Europe.<br> <br>The Ottomans, however, were jubilant; they had finally captured the <i>&#x201c;Kizil Elma&#x201d;</i> (Red or Golden Apple) of their dreams.2 Although Muslims had been sweeping across Asia Minor for some time, the Ottomans, known among themselves as <i>ghazis</i> or holy warriors, had pushed the farthest. By 1326, they had reached the Sea of Marmara across which they could almost see Constantinople. They lusted after that prize not only because of its opulent buildings, its luxury and learning, and its symbolic importance, but also because of its strategic position.<br> <br><br> <br>Strategic location of Constantinople. <i>Map prepared by Lynn Carlson, GISP.</i><br> <br>Constantinople, today&#x2019;s Istanbul, is situated on hills that overlook the place where three waterways meet: the Sea of Marmara, which flows through the Dardanelles out to the Aegean; the Golden Horn, an inlet off the Marmara that divides the city; and the Bosphorus, a strait that leads up from the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea. Thus, whoever controlled Constantinople controlled travel and trade from ports in the Black Sea to those in the Mediterranean and beyond. Although the Byzantine Empire had contracted considerably over the years to contain barely more than the city itself, Constantinople was thought to be impregnable. It was protected by miles of stone walls that were fifteen feet thick and more than forty feet high, with evenly dispersed towers that were twice as high. There were three sets of walls in all, one inside the other, each separated by a fosse or moat. These fortifications would be put to the test. Ottomans had tried several times to take the city, but had been unsuccessful. They had kept sight of their goal, however, and had made long-term plans; in preparation for the siege of Constantinople, they had conquered a huge swath of territory in Europe: from Gallipoli to Adrianople, from Varna on the Black Sea, to Greece, and then to Kosovo and Bosnia, across the Adriatic from Italy, until Constantinople was effectively surrounded.<br> <br>The ambitious young sultan known as Mehmet II decided that the &#x201c;Apple&#x201d; was finally ripe for the plucking. Late in 1452, he took his army of more than eighty thousand soldiers and marched from his capital in Adrianople toward Constantinople. He quartered his troops at Rumeli Hisari, a fortress his workmen had quickly constructed on the shores of the Bosphorus, a few miles north of the city walls. Rumeli Hisari, or &#x201c;Roman fortress,&#x201d; was built at the narrowest point on the Bosphorus, known as Bogazkesen (throat-cutter), directly across from the Anadolu Hisari, the Anatolian fortress, built by his great-grandfather Beyazit I. From these two forts, the Ottomans could seize any ships coming from the Black Sea, collecting tariffs or confiscating their goods and capturing their crews. By the beginning of 1453 they were ready to begin the siege.<br> <br>In the Ottoman camps, the fires burned all night and the men were whipped into fighting mood by the beat of drums, the shrill high notes of the <i>zurna,</i> and shouting songs that made it difficult for people inside the city to sleep. They also set up their cannons and began an incessant bombardment of the walls in a strategy of &#x201c;shock and awe.&#x201d;<br> <br>The noise and vibration of the massed guns, the clouds of smoke, the shattering impact of stone on stone dismayed seasoned defenders. To the civilian population it was a glimpse of the coming apocalypse and a retribution for sin . . . [it was] according to one Ottoman chronicler, &#x201c;like the awful resurrection blast.&#x201d;3<br> <br>Seeing all this activity, the Byzantines inside the city became terrified; Emperor Constantine XI wrote a desperate letter to Pope Nicholas V, promising to unify the Eastern Orthodox and Western Catholic churches if he would quickly send reinforcements. Although both Catholic and Orthodox were nominally Christian, their enmity was of long standing, ever since the two branches of the Church had split in the eleventh century. &#x201c;Unity,&#x201d; however, would not mean equality between the two branches, but submission of the Orthodox church to the primacy of Rome. Many Byzantines felt that was too high a price to pay for Rome&#x2019;s support, but they were vastly outnumbered. Although the population of the city was about forty thousand, they could count at most five thousand Greek men available to fight. To be sure, there were also about two thousand foreigners&#x2014;some Venetians and Florentines, but mostly Genoese who lived in Galata across the Golden Horn from the Greek part of the city&#x2014;but their loyalty could not be assumed since they were Latin Christians, not Orthodox Christians like the Greeks.<br> <br>Nevertheless, according to a letter written to the pope by Archbishop Leonard, who had been called from Chios to help negotiate the union, the emperor and his senate had agreed to the union and it was apparently confirmed in mid-December 1452.4 For a short time hostilities thawed somewhat, if not among priests and theologians, at least among the people imperiled in the city. They celebrated when a Genoese ship arrived in January 1453 filled with food, supplies, and seven hundred soldiers&#x2014;four hundred from Genoa and three hundred from their colony in Chios, an island in the Aegean. Their arrival provided a much-needed boost to morale to those in the city, especially when they learned that one of the Chian soldiers was Giovanni Giustiniani, who knew how to fortify and repair damaged walls. Knowing that his skill would be essential during the impending siege, Constantine XI, the Byzantine emperor, quickly made him his second-in-command. Some of the Genoese in Galata rushed to join and fight alongside Giustiniani, while others rushed to the ship, hoping to catch passage back to Genoa. But the majority of the Genoese in Constantinople did not want to lose the lucrative trade from their Black Sea colony at Caffa in the Crimea. Luciano Spinola, one of the leading merchants, convinced them to remain neutral in the hope that the Ottomans, like the Byzantines, would appreciate the luxury goods such as caviar and sturgeon that they supplied from that trade.<br> <br>Spring came; the storks returned from their winter sojourn in Africa, and the scent of roses filled the air and the churches. But these joyful signs could not dispel the unease felt by the people trapped inside the city. To add to their anxiety, at the beginning of April, Easter Week, a couple of small earthquakes rattled their already frayed nerves. For weeks, Mehmet&#x2019;s soldiers had provoked small skirmishes along the length of the walls as a way to tire the Christians before the onslaught. For a time, the Christians had the advantage, despite their numbers. Ottoman cannon fire had damaged but not destroyed the walls, and when the soldiers tried to scale them, the Christians could knock them down with stones. Still, the continual assault and the constant vigilance had exhausted them.<br> <br>As an alternative strategy to breaching the walls, the Ottomans began to dig tunnels under them. The Byzantines soon discovered some of the tunnels and set fire to them, capturing soldiers and forcing them to give the locations of other tunnels. They were also aware that there were two vulnerable places along the land walls&#x2014;one at the St. Romanus Gate, located in a depression caused by the Lycus River, and the other at a point where the walls met at right angles, behind the Blachernae Palace. The Ottomans decided to focus on the St. Romanus Gate because the depression rendered the towers lower than hills opposite and also because the riverbed had made it difficult to construct a deep moat. Immediately, they moved their monster cannon into place. It was twenty-seven feet long&#x2014;probably the largest cannon ever constructed at the time&#x2014;and could lob a stone cannonball weighing a thousand pounds against the wall or over it. Never had anything like it been seen. It demolished part of the wall, but at night Giustiniani and his helpers were able to repair it and the assault continued.<br> <br>Near the Golden Horn, the Ottoman fleet was similarly stalled. Aware that their city was most vulnerable through the Golden Horn, the Byzantines had laid a huge chain boom, designed, in fact, by a Genoese, across its entrance to prevent Ottoman ships from entering and attacking both sides of the city. That was a clever strategy but hardly a panacea; they desperately needed more soldiers and supplies from Europe.<br> <br>The pope in Rome had dawdled in sending aid. He had assumed the city was well fortified and couldn&#x2019;t believe God would let it go to the infidels, and he was waiting for assurance that a &#x201c;union&#x201d; between the Greek and Roman churches would be consummated before he sent aid. At the end of March, the pope finally dispatched three Genoese ships, but they got caught in a storm near Chios and did not reach Constantinople until April 20, when they confronted a fleet of Ottoman ships and triremes. Those on land, including Constantine and Mehmet, could only watch as a vicious battle ensued. Against the odds, the Genoese sailors managed to fight off the Ottoman ships and slip through the boom that was opened for them, into the Golden Horn, where they unloaded much-needed supplies.5 This success of the Genoese greatly embarrassed Mehmet II. In response, he devised an ingenious way to circumvent the boom.<br> <br>In the dead of night, on April 22, the Ottomans carried out one of the most amazing military maneuvers of the time, perhaps of all time. On greased logs they rolled seventy-two ships overland up from the Bosphorus, over the hill of Galata, and down into the Golden Horn inside the boom, from where they could easily barrage the city. When the Christians awoke and saw this, they must have felt they were doomed. Yet, miraculously, they would continue to hold the Ottomans at bay for another month.<br> <br>On the twelfth of May, the Ottoman forces came against the palace walls with thousands of soldiers and, according to Nicol� Barbaro, an eyewitness, &#x201c;these Turkish dogs&#x201d; let loose with &#x201c;fierce cries according to their custom, and with sounds of castanets and tambourines . . . they made a strong attack against the walls of the palace, so that the majority of those in the city thought that night that the city was lost.&#x201d;6 Yet the Christians clung to their belief that God would not allow the city to fall to the &#x201c;wicked pagans,&#x201d; at least not until a prophecy, attributed to the first Constantine, was fulfilled. He had prophesied that the city would never fall until the &#x201c;moon rose darkened,&#x201d; and since that had not yet occurred the people inside the city continued hopeful.<br> <br>Two weeks later, however, their hope ran out. On May 24, there was a lunar eclipse, followed by torrential rain, fog, and a strange light that hovered over Hagia Sophia. Among the terrified citizens a rumor spread that &#x201c;the time of the Antichrist had arrived,&#x201d; meaning that the end of the world was nigh. In the Bible, the Antichrist is identified as a powerful leader who will come in the last days to tempt people away from their faith.7 A huge battle will ensue, the Antichrist will be defeated. Christ will come again to judge both the quick and the dead, and the world will end. For the people in Constantinople, it was easy to imagine that Mehmet was the Antichrist and that the end-time was upon them.<br> <br>At this crucial moment, Mehmet tempted Emperor Constantine with terms of surrender. Constantine refused, and summoning the people to Hagia Sophia, he warned them that the great battle for the fate of the world was imminent. He told them that they should be ready to die for their faith, their country, their family, and their sovereign. Encouraged by his words, Greek and Latin Christians united against their common enemy, the Muslims. After taking communion together, the men went back to their posts, and the women carried water to refresh them and collected stones for them to rain down upon the enemy.<br> <br>On the night of May 28, after fifty-four days of continual siege, the Ottoman camp was deathly quiet. The Greeks hoped against hope that the Ottomans had given up. But at dawn, when the sun was shining directly into the Christians&#x2019; eyes, the elite Janissary corps8 of the Ottoman forces stormed the walls and a ferocious battle ensued. Still, the Christians held on. When the emperor saw that his commander-in-chief was missing, he &#x201c;went in great distress to see where he had gone&#x201d; and learned that Giustiniani had been wounded by an arrow and had left his post on the ramparts. When he found him, he pleaded, &#x201c;I beg you; your flight will encourage others to do the same. Your wound is not mortal; bear the pain and stay at your post like a man, as you promised to do.&#x201d; But Giustiniani fled, and &#x201c;as he fled, he went through the city crying &#x2018;the Turks have got into the city!&#x2019;&#x201d;9 Hearing this, many of the people panicked and abandoned their posts to follow him, hoping to escape on the ships. Many later believed that had he remained, their city might not have been lost. Constantine and his men continued fighting bravely. It is said that the emperor, proclaiming he would rather die fighting for his city than live among the infidels, dismounted his horse and joined the fray. He was last seen, sword in hand, disappearing into the crowd.

At the urging of the FBI, Jordan becomes both hunter and hunted in a search for the anonymous artist&#x2014;an obsessed killer who seems to know more about Jordan and her family than she is prepared to face...</p><p>Greg Iles lives up to the promise of his previous bestseller, <i>24 Hours</i>, with a new thriller that showcases his ability to deliver top-level suspense as well as multidimensional characterization. When Jordan Glass, a world-renowned photojournalist, happens on an exhibit of a series of paintings known as "The Sleeping Women," she is stunned to discover that one of the models--a nude who, like the other women in the paintings, looks dead rather than asleep--is her mirror image. But Jordan knows the face in the painting isn't her; it's her twin sister, Jane, who disappeared from her New Orleans home more than a year ago, and is presumed to have been murdered by a serial killer who's been snatching women off the streets of the Crescent City for at least that long. None of the bodies of the missing women have turned up, but their faces match the models in the other Sleeping Women paintings. A veteran FBI agent named John Kaiser brings Jordan into the Bureau's hunt for the anonymous artist, who may also know something about the disappearance of Jordan's father in Vietnam almost 30 years before. <p> This is a taut, well-crafted thriller with a nice secondary love story that's woven into the action without slowing it down. Jordan is a fascinating, many-sided character who's a little too tough to be wholly believable, but that's a minor quibble. While winning well-deserved new fans for Iles, <i>Dead Sleep</i> will keep his readers awake until the very last page. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><b>Greg Iles</b> is the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Penn Cage series.

But more importantly, she writes of a God who acts on behalf of His children, of a faith that grew in the crucible of China, and of learning how to effectively share the gospel.</p><p></p><p>Grace&#x2019;s stories are raw, personal, and humorous, and she openly shares about her own spiritual struggles and growth.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Grace Jacob served the Lord (with her husband and two sons) in Hong Kong and Mainland China from 1986-2015, where she was passionate about sharing the gospel in a way that respected the beliefs of her friends. By God&#x2019;s grace she led many atheists, Buddhists, idol-worshippers, and an animist to the Lord. She speaks the heart languages of her Chinese friends&#x2014;Cantonese and Mandarin. Grace loves telling a good story, whether around a BBQ with friends, or while speaking on evangelism in front of audiences around the nation. She holds a Bachelor of Biology, and she also holds a Master of Divinity from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. Grace has been published in <em>Decision</em> magazine. She now lives in the woods in Bend, Oregon with her husband and black cat.</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Dragon Ride</em> is the most exciting modern mission book I have ever read. It is a lively narration of how God used a former atheist to reach atheists and others in one of the greatest mission fields in the world&#x2014;China. It is realistic but positive, a God-centered, and God-empowered view of outreach work that will rekindle the desire to reach the &#x201c;unreachable.&#x201d; Pastors, youth leaders, teachers, parents, Christian apologists, as well as students, will profit greatly from the techniques learned from three decades of on-the-job experience.&#x201d; <br><strong>Norman Geisler, Ph.D. <br>Apologist and co-author of <em>I Don&#x2019;t Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist</em></strong></p> <p>&#x201c;There are books that we should read, and books that we want to read. This book is a rare blend of both. Grace Jacob has written an important book about her 29 years as a career missionary in China with her husband and family. The stories are riveting, and it is literally a compulsive page-turner. Jacob&#x2019;s writing style is clear, descriptive and emotionally-accessible, and I could hardly put it down. It challenged me in how I need to address the felt needs of people I want to share Christ with, in my own sphere of influence.&#x201d; <br><strong>Dr. John Townsend, New York Times bestselling author, and co-author of <em>Boundaries</em>, from the Foreword</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;Buckle your seat belts for an adventure at every turn (of the page) and in multiple dimensions! I could not put it down. Grace, the author and guide to this adventure, has chosen vignette after vignette to immerse you into the &#x2018;not-for-the-faint-of-heart&#x2019; challenges and realities of living and working in China and following a God-given north star. And, the adventure is made even more vivid because it is told with truth, grit, wit, wisdom, and heart. Yet it gets better than that because of Grace&#x2019;s blessed awareness of physical, spiritual, cultural, and biblical contexts. Grace&#x2019;s battle-tested journey&#x2014;and the journeys of those she loves&#x2014;are on view. You&#x2019;ll be boldly encouraged and inspired to answer God&#x2019;s call for your own life.&#x201d; <br><strong>Dr. Benjamin K. Homan <br>President, Langham Partnership (formerly John Stott Ministries)</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;As an American pastor I&#x2019;ve always dreamt of spending time in a far-away culture as a gospel carrier ... But the reality is that I probably never will. And yet, after reading <em>Dragon Ride</em>, I feel that I have. I feel as though I&#x2019;ve been a missionary in China without ever stepping foot on its soil. Every fear, tear, struggle, adjustment, joy, relationship, conversation, and gospel triumph recorded here became mine. Honest, sincere, human, and accessible. I found this work extremely easy to pick up and hard to put down. But what inspired me the most was the gospel-centered intentionality and heart of Grace. She was a woman, a wife, and a mother on mission, to the glory of God. I will be putting this book in the hands of everyone in our church, that we, too, may be diligently committed to tell the good news of him who saves all people everywhere. Evangelistically inspiring!&#x201d; <br><strong>David Thompson <br>Pastor, The Door, Three Rivers, OR</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;You will laugh and be inspired as you witness this bold family live out their faith.&#x201d; <br><strong>Brenden Bridges <br>Pastor, Richvale Evangelical Free Church, Richvale, CA</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;Having lived for 20 years in China, one observes a range of people who come and go. Some, and rightfully so, are there for only a brief season, know little of the people and culture, and leave with an interesting life experience. A very few others integrate into the culture and become vital contributors to the expansion of God&#x2019;s kingdom in that great land. The Jacobs are most definitely in the latter category. Observing their lives and ministry was one of the great privileges of our life in Asia.&#x201d; <br><strong>Tom Lowder, ThM, PhD</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;This is a beautifully written story of a courageous American woman who, along with her husband and two sons, made her home in China for 29 years. It describes her unsettling journey as a young person through atheism, and then traces her extraordinary life in coming to know and love the Lord Jesus Christ. Why should any of us pay the cost of being an authentic follower of Jesus? <em>Dragon Ride</em> shows us that a lifetime of overcoming hurts and obstacles in loving obedience to Jesus is never a waste, but is a doorway to the most fruitful, adventurous, and meaningful life possible. This amazing, life-changing story of one who gave up everything for the sake of giving voice to Christ&#x2019;s culture-embracing love beautifully illustrates the words of Jesus when he said &#x2018;For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel&#x2019;s will save it.&#x2019;&#x201d; (Mark 8:35, NASB) <br><strong>David Ewert <br>Pastor Emeritus, New Hope Church, Winston, OR <br>Ministry Resource, Emmanuel Reformed Church, Castleton, NY</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;I never imagined I&#x2019;d see God moving in a Communist country like China until I got to know Grace and Justin. They worked underground, secretly sharing God&#x2019;s grace in Jesus Christ. <em>Dragon Ride</em> is an inspiring story of God&#x2019;s call, his equipping, and his faithfulness to carry out the task.&#x201d; <br><strong>Jim Cashwell <br>Area Director, Charlotte/Knoxville <br>Joni and Friends International Disability Ministry</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;This is a thrilling account of the grace of God demonstrated in the lives of humble servants who were called to a seemingly impossible assignment in China. Justin and Grace Jacob shine with the beauty of Jesus when facing danger, stress, illness, persecution, trials, and spiritual warfare.&#x201d; <br><strong>Dr. John H Munro <br>Senior Pastor, Calvary Church, Charlotte, NC</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;<em>Dragon Ride</em> is a well-written and insightful look into the lives of missionaries serving in a creative access country. It is filled with true life experiences shared in an easy-to-read short story format. I also found the author's candid honesty about her personal challenges refreshing, particularly as they demonstrate what God can accomplish through fallible human beings who obey God&#x2019;s directions and courageously follow him. In short, an inspiring book.&#x201d; <br><strong>Dr. Jim Isaacson <br>Pastor, Portland Avenue Evangelical Free Church, Tacoma, WA.</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;When I&#x2019;m not laughing, crying, or repenting, creepy chills are running down my spine.&#x201d; <br><strong>Suzette, a homemaker, while reading <em>Dragon Ride</em></strong></p></p><h2>Ethics for a Brave New World, Second Edition (Updated and Expanded)</h2><p><p>Aldous Huxley&#x2019;s 1932 book&nbsp;<em>Brave New World</em>&nbsp;foresees a world in which technological advances have obliterated morality and freedom. John Feinberg and Paul Feinberg, in the first edition of&nbsp;<em>Ethics for a Brave New World</em>, noted how Huxley landed frighteningly close to the truth. Their book responded to ethical crises such as abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, and genetic engineering by looking to Scripture for principles to guide us through the moral quagmires of our time.</p><p>Now dramatically updated and expanded, this edition of&nbsp;<em>Ethics for a Brave New World</em>&nbsp;seeks to maintain the relevance, rigorous scholarship, and biblical faithfulness of the first edition. While many of the topics covered in the book remain the same, John Feinberg has revised each chapter to keep it current with contemporary trends and to respond to the most recent scholarship. There is a new chapter on stem cell research and greatly expanded material on issues such as homosexuality and genetic engineering. This important resource will be a valuable guide for students and those seeking answers to ethical dilemmas.</p></p><p><p><strong>John S.

She leapt up to the sill, curling up and resting her forehead against the reinforced bars.<br> <br>The poor warlord with his broad shoulders and jet-black hair was about to join a legion of other males&#x2014;the ones whose last sight had been her smiling face.<br> <br>She tilted her head when he ducked and ran through an enemy. He was a big male, at least six and a half feet tall, but surprisingly fast.<br> <br>She knew fighting and liked his style. Dirty. He&#x2019;d cut with his sword then strike out with his fist, or dodge a thrust then throw an elbow.<br> <br>What she wouldn&#x2019;t give to be down there fighting. In the middle. Against both sides. Against him.<br> <br>She fought dirtier.<br> <br>His attention continued to stray toward her; once he&#x2019;d even killed while his gaze was still on her. She&#x2019;d blown him a kiss, sincerely, choosing to see it as a tribute.<br> <br>He found time to glance back even as he thundered orders to the army of rebel vampires. His strategy was brilliant, she grudgingly admitted, even though some of his men used firearms.<br> <br>Loreans scorned human weapons like these. Guns could only kill humans, which was beyond unsporting.<br> <br>Yet pesky bullets&#x2014;aside from ruining couture&#x2014;hurt. They could immobilize an immortal for precious seconds, long enough for a dirty fighter to take a foe&#x2019;s head. Used enough times, they could help take an &#x201c;untakable&#x201d; castle like Ivo the Cruel&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Ivo. Her jailer and tormentor.<br> <br>Myst hardly cared that he was about to have his ass handed to him. Her situation wouldn&#x2019;t change, because these rebels, turned humans known as the Forbearers, were still vampires.<br> <br>A blood foe is a blood foe is a blood foe. . . .<br> <br>An explosion rocked the castle, then another. And another. Debris rained from the dungeon ceiling. In neighboring cells, low beings&#x2014;those who made up the creature-feature underbelly of the Lore&#x2014;howled.<br> <br>With each blast, their wails increased in volume, until . . . the battle was over.<br> <br>Silence. An aftershock here and there. A muted whimper.<br> <br>The defense of this castle was no more.<br> <br>Invading rebels searched for enemies, but Ivo and his men weren&#x2019;t fight-to-the-death sorts. They&#x2019;d probably teleported. He who fights and runs away, lives to run away another day. Ha.<br> <br>The sound of heavy footsteps echoed inside the dungeon. Someone was making his way down the corridor, directly to her cell. . . .<br> <br>The warlord appeared on the other side of the bars.<br> <br>From her perch in the window, she examined him. He had thick, straight black hair that hung over his face in careless sections, as if he&#x2019;d sheared them off with a blade. Some hanks were kept from his field of vision with those small ravel plaits like the berserkers used to wear. His body was powerful, his muscles swollen from use.<br> <br>She wanted to purr&#x2014;central casting had just sent her a fierce warlord!<br> <br>&#x201c;Come down from there, woman.&#x201d; Deep voice. Russian accent, moneyed, aristocratic.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or what? You&#x2019;ll lock me away in a dungeon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I might free you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She was at the bars before he&#x2019;d had time to lower his gaze from the window. Had his squared jaw slackened a touch? She listened for a quickening of his heart, but he had no heartbeat whatsoever.<br> <br>So the vampire was single?<br> <br>His eyes were clear of the red haze that marked bloodlust, which meant he had never drunk a being to death. But then a Forbearer never took blood straight from the flesh.<br> <br>Even after beholding her face up close, he didn&#x2019;t immediately shove the key into the lock to free her. Yet his lips parted, exposing his fangs for her to see. His were kind of sexy&#x2014;not too prominent or even much longer than a human&#x2019;s canines.<br> <br>When she saw the short, splendid scar that passed down both of his lips, her lightning struck just outside. Scars, any external evidence of pain, attracted Myst. Pain forged strength. Strength begat electricity. This one could give it to her.<br> <br>He might even be missing an eye under a thick hank of hair.<br> <br>She stifled a throaty moan as her hand shot out to brush his hair back. But he was quick, catching her wrist. When she curled one finger in a beckoning gesture, he released her, allowing her to reach forward. She brushed his hair back, revealing a hard-planed, masculine face covered with grit and ash from the battle.<br> <br>He was still in possession of both of his eyes, and they were intense. Flinty gray.<br> <br>She dropped her hand and gripped the bars, lazily stroking them as her gaze dipped to his mouth again. She was surprised by how carnal she found it, especially since the vampire could use it to hurt her.<br> <br>The gold chain she&#x2019;d worn around her waist for millennia now felt heavy on her.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you?&#x201d; he asked in his pleasingly low voice.<br> <br>She realized his accent was actually Estonian, not Russian. The general was from neighboring Estonia, which made him a kind of Nordic Russian (though she doubted he would appreciate that description). She frowned at his question and pulled back her hair to reveal her pointed ear. &#x201c;Nothing?&#x201d; She parted her lips and tapped her tongue against her small, dormant fangs. No recognition.<br> <br>Rumors in the Lore held that King Kristoff and his Forbearers knew little of their fellow immortals. The male before her was an army leader, a general most likely, and he hadn&#x2019;t a clue she was a Valkyrie.<br> <br>An enemy.<br> <br>Killing these Forbearers would be easy for her and her sisters. Too easy. Like being your own secret Santa.<br> <br>Myst had just confirmed rumors of asses and elbows&#x2014;and this army&#x2019;s inability to differentiate between the two.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;What are you?&#x201d; Nikolai demanded again, surprised his voice was steady.<br> <br>When he&#x2019;d seen this female in the light, he&#x2019;d felt like exhaling a stunned breath&#x2014;if his kind respired.<br> <br>Flawless skin, coral lips, flame-red hair. The eyes that flickered over him were an impossible green.<br> <br>She was strikingly lovely, with a beauty only hinted at from a distance. On the battlefield, he&#x2019;d been recklessly drawn to her.<br> <br>Though she clearly expected him to recognize her kind, he could determine only that she wasn&#x2019;t human. Her ears said fey, but she also had the smallest fangs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Free me,&#x201d; the creature said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Swear fealty to my king, and I will.&#x201d;<br> <br>The way she held the bars was suggestive; everything about her was . . . suggestive. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do that, but you&#x2019;ve no right to keep me here.&#x201d;<br> <br>His brother Murdoch passed by, raised his eyebrows at Nikolai&#x2019;s discovery, and muttered in Estonian, &#x201c;Sweet Christ.&#x201d; Then he walked on.<br> <br>Why was Nikolai unable to do the same? &#x201c;What are you?&#x201d; He wasn&#x2019;t used to his questions going unanswered. &#x201c;And what&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>Another stroke of the bars. &#x201c;What do you want it to be?&#x201d;<br> <br>He scowled. &#x201c;Are you a vampire?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not the last time I checked.&#x201d; Her voice was sensual. He couldn&#x2019;t place her drawling accent.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you innocent of malice against us?&#x201d;<br> <br>She gave a dismissive wave. &#x201c;Oh, good gods, no. I love to kill leeches.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then rot in here.&#x201d; As if she could kill a vampire. She was scarcely over five feet tall and delicately built&#x2014;aside from the generous breasts showcased in her tight shirt.<br> <br>When he turned to go, she called after him, &#x201c;I smell smoke. Ivo the Cruel burned his records before he fled, didn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nikolai stilled, clenching his fists because he&#x2019;d have to return. &#x201c;Correct,&#x201d; he grated at the cell once more.<br> <br>&#x201c;And this new king&#x2019;s army is full of Forbearers&#x2014;turned humans?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet you chose to attack this particular Horde stronghold&#x2014;over the four others, including the royal seat&#x2014;because you needed Oblak&#x2019;s records.&#x201d;<br> <br>How did she know their agenda so well?<br> <br>Nikolai could plan battles and sieges&#x2014;he&#x2019;d earned his rank by this victory alone&#x2014;but he knew nothing of this new world that would help to advance the army. Unfortunately, he wasn&#x2019;t the only one.<br> <br>&#x201c;The blind leading the blind,&#x201d; King Kristoff had muttered when they&#x2019;d found the records reduced to a smoldering heap of ash.<br> <br>&#x201c;You think to bargain for your freedom?&#x201d; Nikolai said. &#x201c;If you do happen to have information, I can torture you for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t recommend that,&#x201d; she said with a laugh. &#x201c;I dislike torture and grow sulky under pincers.&#x201d;<br> <br>The things in the other cells, many of which he never could have imagined, howled at that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, let&#x2019;s not quarrel, vampire. Free me, and we&#x2019;ll go to your room and talk.&#x201d; She offered her graceful hand to him. A smudge of ash was stark against her alabaster skin.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll call for me. You&#x2019;ll be lonely in your new quarters and will feel out of sorts. I could let you pet my hair until you fall asleep.&#x201d;<br> <br>He drew in closer to ask in all seriousness, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re mad, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As&#x2014;a&#x2014;hatter,&#x201d; she murmured back.<br> <br>He felt a hint of sympathy for the creature. &#x201c;How long have you been in here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For four long . . . interminable . . . days.&#x201d;<br> <br>He glowered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Which is why I want you to take me with you. I don&#x2019;t eat much.&#x201d;<br> <br>The dungeon erupted with laughter again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t hold your breath, female.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Certainly not like you, Forbearer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How did you know what I am? And who we are?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know everything.&#x201d;<br> <br>If true, she had a wealth they lacked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Leave her,&#x201d; Murdoch called at the gateway of the dungeon. His brows were drawn, no doubt in puzzlement at his brother&#x2019;s interest.<br> <br>Nikolai had never pursued women. When he&#x2019;d been human, they&#x2019;d either come to him or he&#x2019;d gone without. He&#x2019;d had no time during the war. As a vampire, he had no such need. Not until he could find his Bride.<br> <br>He shook his head at the insane, fey creature, then forced himself to walk on. But he thought he heard her whisper, &#x201c;Call for me, General,&#x201d; making the hair on the back of his neck stand up.<br> <br>He followed his brother to Kristoff&#x2019;s new suite. Their king was gazing out into the night from a generous window&#x2014;one that would be shuttered at dawn. When he turned to them, his gaunt face looked weary.<br> <br>Kristoff was the sole natural-born vampire among them. Killing his own kind must have been difficult for him, no matter how crazed the Horde had become&#x2014;and no matter that they followed his uncle Demestriu, who&#x2019;d stolen his crown centuries ago.<br> <br>Nikolai had no such hesitation. He was weary, but only because hacking through the Horde had overworked his sword arm. &#x201c;Were any of the records salvageable?&#x201d; he asked with little hope.<br> <br>If the vampires of this castle had spent as much energy fighting as burning, they might have kept Oblak. To Wroth&#x2019;s disgust, they&#x2019;d fled. He didn&#x2019;t understand it. When defending your home, you fought to the death.<br> <br>He had.<br> <br>Kristoff answered, &#x201c;None.&#x201d;<br> <br>The rules of this new world were complex and often counterintuitive. Without those records, their own ignorance would defeat them.<br> <br>Kristoff, the rightful Horde king, had been raised by humans far from Demestriu&#x2019;s reach. For centuries he had lived among mortals, hiding his true nature and discovering little of the Lore. His army consisted of human warriors he&#x2019;d turned as they died on the battlefield, so they knew nothing more than he did.<br> <br>Nikolai had thought vampires were mere myths until Kristoff had stood over him like an angel of death, offering eternal life in exchange for eternal fealty.<br> <br>The Forbearers were trapped in a kind of twilight&#x2014;no longer human and yet universally shunned by all the factions of the Lore. Those beings hid in the shadows, fleeing from whatever land Kristoff&#x2019;s army occupied, working together to be one step ahead.<br> <br>Loreans had kept themselves hidden from humanity for ages. That same effort went into keeping Kristoff&#x2019;s soldiers in the dark.<br> <br>&#x201c;Any sign of Conrad or Sebastian?&#x201d; Kristoff asked.<br> <br>Nikolai shook his head. He hadn&#x2019;t seen his two other brothers since shortly after they&#x2019;d been turned. But natural-born vampires often clashed with turned humans, so he and Murdoch had distantly hoped the pair might be in the dungeon of this castle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps the next Horde stronghold.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nikolai nodded, though he doubted it. He feared his brother Bastian was dead and believed the mind of the youngest, Conrad, was unreachable even if he could be found. The two had not appreciated the eternal life Nikolai and Murdoch had forced on them.<br> <br>Murdoch seemed unconcerned that they hadn&#x2019;t located their brothers, but then he generally seemed unconcerned about everything.<br> <br>Though they shared similar looks, he and Nikolai couldn&#x2019;t have been more different in personality. Nikolai believed in Kristoff&#x2019;s cause, seeing many parallels to his own past, and wanted to continue to fight. Murdoch didn&#x2019;t particularly care. Nikolai suspected his brother fought only as a favor to him&#x2014;or because they had nothing else now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nikolai found a being in the dungeon,&#x201d; Murdoch said. &#x201c;She seems to have extensive knowledge of the Lore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of being?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nikolai answered, &#x201c;I have no idea. She appears fey, with pointed ears. But she also has small fangs, and her fingernails are more like . . . claws. She&#x2019;s not a vampire.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kristoff frowned at that. &#x201c;Perhaps she&#x2019;s born of more than one species?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Possibly.&#x201d; More speculation. Nikolai was sick of it. He wanted to know the rules of the game.<br> <br>So he could dominate it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Find out everything you can from her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She won&#x2019;t talk,&#x201d; Nikolai said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve interrogated enough to predict that. And she hates vampires.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kristoff&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;Then we&#x2019;ll treat her as the Horde would. If we haven&#x2019;t extracted information from the rest of the prisoners by tomorrow night, torture her for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nikolai nodded, but the idea sat ill with him. As a human, he&#x2019;d been merciless to his enemies, but he&#x2019;d never tortured a woman.<br> <br>She isn&#x2019;t truly a woman, he reminded himself. She was a Lore female, and their army&#x2019;s survival could depend on the knowledge she held.<br> <br>Perhaps he&#x2019;d never tortured a woman because he&#x2019;d never needed to.<br> <br>As he made his way to his new chambers, Nikolai realized the creature had been right. He was going to call her up to him.<br> <br>To do what with her, he didn&#x2019;t know.</p><h2>Think Like A Champion: A Guide to Championship Performance for Student-Athletes</h2><p>Covering everything from overconfidence, choking under pressure, lack of confidence, and playing with teammates you don't like, to slumps, doldrums, academics, and how to increase speed and quickness, <i>Think Like a Champion</i> is a valuable guide for student athletes who want to excel at their chosen sport.

Moreover, the book provides detailed evidence that the traditional view of cancer as a genetic disease has been largely responsible for the failure to develop effective therapies and preventive strategies.</p> <p><i>Cancer as a Metabolic Disease</i> reevaluates the origins of cancer based on the latest research findings as well as several decades of studies exploring the defects in tumor cell energy metabolism. Author Thomas Seyfried is a biochemical geneticist who has been investigating the lipid biochemistry of cancer for thirty years. In this book, he carefully establishes why approaching cancer as a metabolic disease leads to better understanding and management of all aspects of the disease, including inflammation, vascularization, cell death, drug resistance, and genomic instability. In addition, the book explores:</p> <ul> <li>Origin of metastasis</li> <li>New treatment strategies that target tumor cell energy metabolism, including the ketogenic diet</li> <li>More effective prevention strategies in light of the metabolic origin of cancer</li> <li>Case studies and perspectives from the point of view of physicians, patients, and caregivers</li> </ul> <p>Throughout the book, tables, figures, and graphs summarize key information and clarify complex concepts. In addition, the renowned cancer biochemist Peter Pedersen from Johns Hopkins Medical School also provides a historical perspective on the importance of the information presented in his foreward to the book.</p> <p><i>Cancer as a Metabolic Disease</i> is essential reading for all cancer researchers and clinicians as well as public health professionals. By treating cancer as a metabolic disease, the book sets readers on a new, more promising path to understanding the origins of cancer and developing new, more effective strategies to treat and prevent it.</p><p><b>THOMAS N.

Earl Shoaff, Jim Rohn's personal mentor, gives the presentation that changed Jim's life! Anyone who ever heard Jim Rohn speak, knows the impact that Earl Shoaff had on his life. Here is a transcription of the recording of the presentation by Earl Shoaff that changed Jim's life and provides the secrets to his success. By the time Jim Rohn reached the age of 25, he was married, had a family and worked as a stock clerk at Sears earning $57 a week take home pay. Finding himself falling behind on his bills, and with nothing in the bank to fall back on, he knew he wanted more out of life but had no idea on how to make it happen. Then something happened to him that changed his life forever and gave him the answers he was looking for. The same good fortune that happened to Jim all those years ago is about to happen to you! One of Jim's friends told him about a man he had gone to work for. This man was very rich and wise. He had an incredible philosophy about life and he was easy to talk to. His friend talked about this man so much that Jim's curiosity got the better of him and he went to hear what this man had to say. Jim walked into the room and took a seat. He really didn't know what to expect, but he kept an open mind and listened intently as the speaker opened his eyes to a world he never knew existed. A world where you could truly be anything you wanted to be and you could have anything you wanted to have! Jim said of the experience, "To this day, I can't tell you exactly what he said, I just knew that I would have given anything to be like him." Then, standing at the back of the room, he got an idea. He thought that, somehow, if he could just get around this man, maybe he could learn the secrets of wealth and happiness.</p></p><p></p><h2>Have You Seen My Dragon?</h2><p><b>Enter a fascinating, ornately drawn cityscape and help a boy find his dragon while counting objects from hot dogs to traffic lights.</b><br><br>In the heart of the city, among the taxis and towers, a small boy travels uptown and down, searching for his friend.

Then, after a chance encounter with a leprechaun, Jamie finds himself growing the biggest potato in the world. But what will happen when the potato grows too large for Jamie and the villagers to handle?</p><p>"Jamie O'Rourke is the laziest man in all of Ireland." So begins well-known children's book author and illustrator Tomie dePaola's retelling of a popular Irish folktale. Jamie is accustomed to his wife doing all the household and garden chores, so when she injures her back, he figures he's sure to starve to death. But as luck would have it, he chances upon a leprechaun. The elfin man offers Jamie the biggest "pratie" in the world in exchange for letting him go. <p> Feeling self-satisfied, Jamie plants the seed, which soon grows into a potato big enough to be a logistical nightmare for the village. Luckily, his wife comes through for him once again, and everyone ends up happy and full. This is not a redemptive tale--Jamie does not learn to be industrious.

When you look at your house, sometimes you can see the clutter. Then there are times when you are immune to your clutter; it can be right in front of you and you don't see it. It starts gradually slipping in your door while the other stuff you already have is just waiting to be loved. Eventually clutter gains a foothold and you don't know where to start to get rid of it. It seems like such an overwhelming task; what is a person supposed to do with all this stuff?</p><p>Over the years, the same thing has happened to our body. As children, our little child brain and body absorbed every word and morsel of food that came even close to us. We were starving for knowledge and attention, and our tiny body needed love, food, and movement to continue to grow. Some of the messages told us that we could have it "all," while others said, "If you don't do it right, don't do it at all." We were stuck wanting it "all" and afraid even to try because what if we failed? Then you toss in the time factor of perfectionism and you will find the ultimate killer of souls: procrastination. "I don't have time!" That is, we don't have time to do it right, so we do nothing at all.</p><p>This thought process is part of our Body Clutter. It is one of our many attitudes that have helped us to collect the clutter that is on our thighs, tummy, and backside. Just like with our homes, our body did not become cluttered overnight. It took years of stinking thinking to collect our Body Clutter. It happened so gradually that the only time we really noticed was when we had to reach for a larger dress size. Do you remember the horror the first time you got a bigger size? Are you immune to it now? </p><p>This book is not one of those magic pills you have been searching for. It has been a difficult journey for us, but we have celebrated every BabyStep we have taken. With each step we have released some of our negative thinking and with it the hold on our physical Body Clutter. </p><p>Over the years we have collectively lost and gained millions of pounds; we are good at starving ourselves and losing the weight when we are forced into decluttering for a special occasion. Anytime you declutter for the wrong reasons, the clutter is going to come back and usually increase. We have all done the stash-and-dash around the house to get ready for a visit from our mother-in-law. That is what we do to our body, too. </p><p>The age-old problem for anyone who has ever been on a "diet" is how to keep the pounds off once you are no longer depriving yourself. Leanne and I believe with all our hearts that the answer to this problem is not in the future but in the past. If we can figure out for ourselves how we acquired the Body Clutter in the first place and the attitude that put it there, then we are a step closer to eliminating it from our body. If we declutter the negative thinking first, it is going to help us stop gaining more Body Clutter. Then, by replacing our negative thought patterns with positive ones, we will gradually decrease the Body Clutter we already have.</p><p>Here is what happens when we don't declutter our negative attitudes. We decide to lose weight for whatever reason, we lose a few pounds, then something upsets us and we fall back into our old childhood habits of reaching for a "comfort cookie." It happened to me just the other day. I got my feelings hurt and I cried. I was crushed, and the first thought I had was to look in the freezer for a chocolate ice pop. What made me do that? It was almost instinctive! Immediately I saw it for what it was: a Band-Aid to comfort my hurting soul. This is how I used to deal with my hurt feelings; I would head to the refrigerator to stuff my face so I would not have to deal with what was really wrong. Before, I would not have been able to stop myself because I didn't know that my eating in response to feeling hurt was just as abusive as the comment that hurt my feelings in the first place. I just wanted to feel better and stop crying. This kind of behavior is not only instinctive but also very human.</p><p>When we are babies and we cry, what happens? We get fed. When we misbehave in the grocery store, we are given a cookie to keep us quiet. Do you see the pattern here? It starts out as instinctual but ends up creating a pattern for self-destructive behavior. We are going to learn to recognize this Body Clutter for what it is -- self-abuse. </p><p>Several years ago I began to FLY (Finally Loving Yourself), but it did not happen overnight. In fact, I am still learning how to love myself in almost every area of my life. My first BabySteps were about getting rid of the clutter and CHAOS (Can't Have Anyone Over Syndrome) in my life. I wanted to feel good about my home, but that is really hard to do when you are not feeling good about yourself. </p><p>It all started with shining my sink, and from that starting point, I began to take better care of my outward appearance, too. There is just something about walking into the bathroom and smiling at what you see in the mirror. It is kind of like going into your kitchen the morning after you have shined your sink for the first time -- that smile radiates to the core of your being and it continues to surprise you each time you go into the kitchen and see your shining sink. Body Clutter is painful. Leanne and I have both suffered from the ridicule and snide comments. Those hurtful words and looks do not make us who we are. We wrote this book to help you find peace. Peace with food, movement, and, most of all, the attitude that has created your Body Clutter. We look in your faces and know that you are suffering just like we are. This book is our journey. It is because of you that we were able to address our own Body Clutter, and we thank you for that. We have given you our hearts and pray that our journey will help you release your own Body Clutter. </p><p></p><p>I have struggled with my weight since the birth of my first child. The battle began after I gained more than fifty pounds with my daughter, and then gave birth to my son less than two years later. At that point my weight became more of a concern than I ever wanted it to be.</p><p>I had lost a baby the prior year to miscarriage, so when I found out I was pregnant with my daughter, I was determined to be the healthiest pregnant mom on the planet. First up on my be-healthy list was my diet. Prepregnancy, I ate erratically and only when my blood sugar crashed, and when I did eat I would pig out. I was a very picky eater who didn't like vegetables, but I trained myself to eat all of them -- and like them! I ate regular meals but was overcome by the myth of eating for two and continued to pig out at each meal as if it were my last. Sundays after church became an excuse to belly up to a double cheeseburger, sides of fries and onion rings, and don't forget the chocolate shake! That was my splurge day, never mind that I had been splurging all week! I gained fifty-two pounds and ultimately gave birth to a nearly ten-pound baby.</p><p>With my second pregnancy, a new interest in nutrition helped keep my weight gain down to a manageable twenty-seven pounds. Unfortunately, the previous pregnancy's weight was still firmly in place. </p><p>I decided to become a nutritionist right after the birth of my son. The funny thing is that at the time I wasn't even interested in nutrition for myself. I just wanted to raise my children in a healthy manner.</p><p>The certification course I was taking would normally take two years to complete, but it took me only six months. My mentors, whom the school assigns its students, couldn't believe I was going through everything so rapidly, but I was determined to get it done ASAP so I would be qualified to feed my children healthy meals, as well as help other mothers with nutrition issues. </p><p>In between taking care of two babies, I studied twelve hours a day, often staying up till one or two in the morning. It was awful, but I did get my certification, I did feed my children an unbelievably healthy diet, and I began taking clients for consultations, and speaking to preschools and anyone who would book me. I was on a crusade to tell the world how to feed their children, and yet my bottom continued to bloom into plus sizes. Ironically, I knew that I was talking the talk and not walking the walk, yet at the time it was all about the children.</p><p>The interesting thing about Body Clutter is that it's always there for a reason. It isn't just about overeating or not getting enough exercise. The reasons can vary, but getting to the heart of the matter and finding out why the Body Clutter is there in the first place can be the first step toward liberation. FlyLady and I, and more and more women just like us, are finding this out for ourselves; we have embarked on a journey together and the lightbulbs of enlightenment are going on all over the place. We want to share with you what we have discovered and have been implementing along the way. </p><p>One of the most comforting things I learned was that who I am does not equal my dress size. I am a unique woman, a child of God, with talents, gifts, and abilities that reach beyond the superficiality of size. I hope that when I'm gone, the things said about me will never be about my weight, the size of my jeans, or what color lipstick I wore. Instead, I hope they will say things about my character and that I was a good mom and a good friend. I am blessed with friends and family who love me as I am.</p><p>However, there is always room for improvement. One of the neatest things about the journey of life is the ability to redefine oneself. Self-assessment can be painful at times, but all growing pains lead to growth, which is the important thing. If we are not growing, we are stagnating and, to me, that's a fate worse than death.</p><p>So we go forward on the journey, recognizing that it is a learning process, an opportunity for growth, and that it may be painful at times. Sometimes the progress is amazing and noticeable; other times, it's one step forward and ten steps back. With the right tools, attitude, and a little knowledge, we can go all the way and really learn how to FLY...</p></p><h2>Build Your Own Secret Bookcase Door: Complete Guide With Detailed Plans for Building your own Secret Bookcase Door (Home Security Series)</h2><p>This 24 page 8 x 10&#34; full softcover black and white book is packed 3D illustrations and photographs.

Sheffield outlines the five stages of depression fallout: confusion, self-doubt, demoralization, anger, and finally, the desire to escape. Many people will find relief in the knowledge that their self-blame, guilt, sadness, and resentment are a natural result of living with a depressed person. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Sheffield brings together many real-life examples from the pioneering support group she attends at Beth Israel Medical Center of how people with depression fallout have learned to cope. From setting boundaries to maintaining an outside social life, she gives practical tactics for handling the challenges and emotional stresses on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>"Depression fallout" is the emotional upheaval suffered by the friends and family members of someone who's depressed. Because at any given time, 17 million Americans are suffering from depression, there's a huge number of people suffering from this, says author Anne Sheffield, the daughter of a depressive. She compassionately recalls situations discussed in her support group at New York City's esteemed Beth Israel Hospital to illustrate how "co-sufferers" can successfully cope with their grief, confusion, guilt, and reduced self-esteem. <p> One of the most overlooked yet thoroughly damaged lots of depression fallout victims, she says, are the toddlers and children of depressed mothers. Children with behavioral problems at home and in school may be struggling for attention they don't get from a depressed parent. She writes, "Although a depressed parent of either sex creates problems for a child, the bulk of the research on parental depression and its effects on young children has zeroed in on the mother, because she is the center of a young child's existence: the primary nurturer, teacher, and emotional and social contact. Ideally, a mother is a good listener, communicator, and problem solver; authoritative without being authoritarian; warm and consistent; and tolerant and patient. Mothers in the grip of depression are often just the opposite: harsh, critical, impatient, irritable, and unaffectionate. And because one in every four women will suffer serious depression at some time in her life--more often than not, right in the middle of her prime childbearing years of twenty-five to thirty-five--the research findings are applicable to a very substantial number of children." </p><p> Without being flippant, Sheffield inserts bits of humor into the book. She describes what she calls "sticky-flypaper depressives" as those who blame themselves for everything and anything that has ever gone wrong, whether it be a relationship, or, as one psychiatrist recalled from one patient's session, "the bad Broadway season of 1947." She also gives a thorough analysis of the many causes of depression, illustrates the five stages of depression fallout, and considers the benefits and downfalls of psychotherapy and how a fallout victim may be affected by it. Sheffield offers reassuring advice on how fallout victims can defuse stress and rebuild their self-esteem and social lives, abundant resources and references for support groups and informational organizations, and an extensive list of medications commonly used for the treatment of mental disorders. No matter what the age or relationship of the fallout victim, <i>How You Can Survive When They're Depressed</i> will prove to be a much-needed dose of sympathy.</p>"Anne Sheffield has guided me to fresh recognitions of myself . . .

He collaborated with Francis Bacon and Salvador Dal�, he made diaries with Andy Warhol and toured with Truman Capote, Terry Southern, and the Rolling Stones&#x2015;all of whom are brought to life, literally and figuratively, in his work. He delved into the world of fashion for its beautiful women, taking Vogue stars like Veruschka to Africa and bringing new ones back to the U.S. with him.</p><p>After spending time in Kenya and striking up a friendship with the author Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen) in the early 1960s, Beard bought 50 acres next to her farm with the stipulation that he would film and write about the land and its flora and fauna. He witnessed the dawn of Kenya&#x2019;s population explosion, which challenged finite resources and stressed animal populations&#x2015;including the starving elephants of Tsavo dying by the tens of thousands in a wasteland of eaten trees. So he documented what he saw&#x2015;with diaries, photographs, and collages. He went against the wind in publishing unique and sometimes shocking books of these works, including The End of the Game. The corpses were laid bare; the facts carefully recorded, sometimes in type and often by hand. Beard uses his photographs as a canvas onto which he superimposes multi-layered contact sheets, ephemera, found objects, newspaper clippings that are elaborately embellished with meticulous handwriting, old-master inspired drawings, and often swaths of animal blood used as paint.</p><p>In 2006, TASCHEN first published the book that has come to define his oeuvre, signed by the artist and published in two volumes. It sold out instantly and became a highly sought after collector&#x2019;s item. In the decade since, the monograph has been revived in two smaller versions; but sometimes, bigger is better. Now, the book you haven&#x2019;t been able to get your hands on is available in one large-format volume.</p></p><p>Owen Edwards has written about photography for 30 years for numerous publications including American Photographer, New York Times Magazine, and Smithsonian.<br><br>Steven M.

MK Asante was born in Zimbabwe to American parents: his mother a dancer, his father a revered professor. But as a teenager, MK was alone on the streets of North Philadelphia, swept up in a world of drugs, sex, and violence. MK&#x2019;s memoir is an unforgettable tale of how one precocious, confused kid educated himself through gangs, rap, mystic cults, ghetto philosophy, and, eventually, books. It is an inspiring tribute to the power of literature to heal and redeem us.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Buck</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A story of surviving and thriving with passion, compassion, wit, and style.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Maya Angelou&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;In America, we have a tradition of black writers whose autobiographies and memoirs come to define an era. . . . <i>Buck </i>may be this generation&#x2019;s story.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;NPR</b><br><br>&#x201c;The voice of a new generation. . . .

He&#x2019;s like yay high, albino light, and bulldog stocky. He&#x2019;s got a pug nose with freckles spread across it like crumbs. His nicknames are Ted Money, Reds the Ghost, Teddy Rux, and Thiefadore Burgalor.<br><br>&#x201c;Where ya brother at?&#x201d; Gold ropes dangle over his Tommy Hill hoodie, and the Beijing dye on his shape-up makes his hairline look airbrushed.<br><br>&#x201c;Right here,&#x201d; I say, leaning out the window. Uzi puts the blunt behind his ear. Pushes me aside.<br><br>&#x201c;Ted Money, waddup?&#x201d;<br><br>Ted checks both coasts like a lookout boy. &#x201c;We got a car,&#x201d; he says, hitchhiker thumb shooting backward. &#x201c;A Johnny!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me, D-Rock, and you . . . if you down to roll?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hell yeah,&#x201d; Uzi says, no hesitation, then pivots toward the door. I follow him like his shadow.<br><br>And this is how it always goes: me following Uzi in everything, everywhere, like his little black Jansport, covered in Marks-A-Lot, strapped tight to his back--koala style. Anywhere, anyplace. He does it, I do it. He tries it, fuck it, I&#x2019;m trying it. He can, shit, why can&#x2019;t I? Sometimes I even duck like him under doorways, even though he&#x2019;s way taller and I don&#x2019;t need to duck. I guess I just do it because Uzi&#x2019;s more than my big brother, he&#x2019;s my idol. I don&#x2019;t care that he&#x2019;s taller, and older, and smarter. I wouldn&#x2019;t even really know his age if old people weren&#x2019;t always bringing that shit up, talking &#x2019;bout &#x201c;you can&#x2019;t do this, you can&#x2019;t do that&#x201d;--why?<br><br>&#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s sixteen and you&#x2019;re twelve,&#x201d; they say.<br>I follow him to sweaty Badlands house parties that always end in crazy, shirtless rumbles with everybody howling &#x201c;Norf-side! Norf-side!&#x201d; in the middle of the street. To Broad and Rockland to cop dime bags from one of the dusty bodegas with nothing but baking soda and expired Bisquick on the shelves. To freestyle cyphers on South Street that the nut-ass police always break up for no reason. To crack on jawns getting off the El at 69th Street, like, &#x201c;Yo, shawty, let me holla at you for a minute.&#x201d; To scale the fence to watch Sad Eye, the Jordan of street ball, hoop at 16th and Susquehanna. To skate the ledges and steps at Love Park until we get chased away by the cops. To bomb the Orange Line subway with Sharpies and Kiwi polish sticks.<br><br>And now, to joyride through Philly in a stolen wheel.<br><br>Being with Uzi makes me feel invincible, like nothing bad can happen to us, like nothing and nobody can hurt us. I feel unfuckwitable.<br><br>I can see us now, peeling off, sound system booming louder than bombs, rolling down 5th Street, turning heads as we catch the breeze. This is how freedom must taste.<br><br>&#x201c;Chill,&#x201d; Uzi tells me, pushing me back. &#x201c;Not this time.&#x201d; Turns his shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m down, though,&#x201d; I say, inching forward.<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; he says. Grabs both my arms. &#x201c;But not this time.&#x201d; He lets go. Palms the doorknob.<br><br>Now I&#x2019;m picturing the car spin, all of us laughing, half hanging out the window, tires screaming as we bust victory donuts.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming!&#x201d; I shout loud enough for Ted to hear.<br><br>&#x201c;Ma-lo!&#x201d; Uzi shoves me into the radiator. His eyes tell me to chill. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d; Shuts the door.<br><br>Through the window, I watch them sprint toward a blue Chevy Celebrity. Jailbreak joyful, their stride says they&#x2019;ll never come back.<br>Ten minutes later--<br><br>Uzi and Ted explode back into the crib looking like they just saw a ghost. I&#x2019;m still in the kitchen, still mad about not rolling.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!&#x201d; they gasp, jetting right by me.<br><br>&#x201c;Get in your room, Malo!&#x201d; Uzi yells. They bolt upstairs, doors slamming everywhere like a haunted house. Before I hit the stairs, I peek out the window--oh shit, oh shit, oh shit! There&#x2019;s a light show in front of the crib. Reds, blues, and a gang of whites. The most cops I&#x2019;ve ever seen.<br>I hit the stairs, three at a time. I&#x2019;m almost at the top when an earthquake hits the house. I spin around to see the front door fly off like back draft. It lifts, then slams hard against the wood floor. Black boots trample it like a bridge. The whole house is heaving. The sound of everything crashing, breaking. A battering ram leads a tsunami of blue in. They flood the house. Clenched Glocks pointing every which way.<br><br>&#x201c;Police! Get down! Down!&#x201d; a flushed red face yells. My fingers freeze on the banister as the tide climbs the stairs.<br><br>&#x201c;Down! Down!&#x201d; I&#x2019;m stuck. Can&#x2019;t move. Guns glaring at me, steely-eyed. Pee shoots down my leg.<br><br>&#x201c;Fuck-ing down!&#x201d; Dripping. They pry me from the banister. Drag me down the steps like a rag doll. Clothes ripping. My head hits every step like a mallet over a xylophone. When I get to the bottom, everything sounds gargled like I&#x2019;m underwater, drowning.<br><br>Officer Red Face is six inches from my grill. &#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d; he screams through tight lips. Grabs me. &#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d; Shakes me. &#x201c;Where?&#x201d; Shaking the fuck out of me. Everything&#x2019;s getting pixelated.<br><br>Red Face lets go, charges up the steps.<br><br>My eyes clear, refocus. I make out Uzi kneeling at the top of the steps, elbows over face, nightsticks marching on his head, hands, ribs, neck, back, everywhere. I feel every blow like they&#x2019;re beating me too. I sprint up the stairs again, but they swallow me, holding me down, twisting my arms like a pretzel.<br>I hear my favorite voice--&#x201c;Get the fuck off my little brother&#x201d;--before I black out.<br>2<br><br>By the Time I Get to Arizona<br><br>Uzi tells me they tried to throw the book at him.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky you&#x2019;re still a minor,&#x201d; my pops tells him. &#x201c;If you were eighteen, you&#x2019;d be in the penitentiary.&#x201d; He fills the doorway to Uzi&#x2019;s room like a prison guard. I&#x2019;m sitting on the bed, long-faced, watching Uzi pack for a one-way trip to Arizona.<br><br>My dad&#x2019;s Afro is thick and flat at the back like how Muhammad Ali&#x2019;s jawn was back in the day. He&#x2019;s wearing a black and gold dashiki. He&#x2019;s got a dashiki for every day of the year.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m African,&#x201d; he told Uzi and Ted the other day on the porch. Ted calls Pops &#x201c;Dr. Africa.&#x201d; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I wear African clothes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re from Georgia,&#x201d; Uzi said.<br><br>&#x201c;Being born in Georgia doesn&#x2019;t make me an American any more than being born in an oven makes a cat a biscuit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s an African proverb that says, &#x2018;No matter how long a log sits in a river, it will never become a crocodile.&#x2019; That means that even in a foreign habitat, a snail never loses its shell. Even in America, I&#x2019;m still African.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Here he goes.&#x201d; Uzi shook his head. &#x201c;Always in his Afrocentric bag.&#x201d;<br><br>The newspapers call our father &#x201c;the father of Afrocentricity&#x201d; because he created it.<br>My third eye is my rail, on this L of thought<br><br>With Afrocentric stamps I&#x2019;m mailin thoughts 2<br>Pops is always preaching Afrocentricity. He was a Church of Christ minister way back when, one of those child preachers, and he still sounds like he&#x2019;s in the pulpit when he talks about black people, white people, and the struggle. I remember this debate he took me to at East Stroudsburg University a few years back: him vs. Cornel West vs. Arthur Schlesinger. It was packed, standing room only. I remember how West, this cool black dude with a big Afro and a tight three-piece suit, talked with his hands flying fast like he was conducting an orchestra. And how Schlesinger, this old white guy with hair the color of milk and a red bow tie, sounded like a statue. I remember the cheers, the boos, the ad-libs. Most of all, though, I remember how dope my pops was: his passion, energy, confidence, intelligence. Half the time I didn&#x2019;t even know what he was talking about--hegemony . . . pedagogy . . . subverting the dominant paradigm--but I was proud.<br>Back then I didn&#x2019;t get it, but now I think I do. Afrocentricity basically means that black people should view the world through our own black eyes. It&#x2019;s like the poster my dad has framed in the hallway that says, &#x201c;A people without knowledge of their past is like a tree with no roots.&#x201d;<br>Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion.<br><br>Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin 3<br>Our crib is mad Afrocentric: naked African statues standing everywhere, ritual masks ice-grilling down from the walls, portraits of Martin, Malcolm, Harriet. From the wallpaper to the plates, everything is stamped with Africa.<br><br>Even my favorite porn series, My Baby Got Back, is made by a company called Afro-Centrix Productions. &#x201c;Beauties that give up the booty,&#x201d; the box under my bed says. Mr. Marcus, Lexington Steele, and loudmouthed Wesley Pipes nailing Nubian queens like Janet Jacme, Obsession, Midori, Monique, and Lacey Duvalle in doggy style, reverse cowgirl, and missionary.<br><br>I tell Pops about the other Afro-Centrix and he&#x2019;s disgusted. Say what? But he&#x2019;s the one who&#x2019;s always talking about how black people should have their own stores, own banks, own schools--shouldn&#x2019;t we have our own porn studios too? What&#x2019;s more Afrocentric than black pussy?<br>Uzi doesn&#x2019;t really get down with Afrocentricity. I think he&#x2019;s still mad about the whole Star Wars thing from when we were little. Uzi used to love Star Wars and he kept begging my parents for a Luke Skywalker action figure. Finally my dad took him to Toys R Us. They came back--Uzi was heated.<br><br>&#x201c;He got me Lando Calrissian!&#x201d; Uzi said.<br><br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly! Nobody knows who he is. Lando Calrissian!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fucking Billy Dee Williams! The corny black dude. He has no gun, no weapon, no special powers, and he talks like he&#x2019;s in a goddamn Colt 45 commercial, like&#x201d;--he lowered his voice--&#x201c; &#x2018;the power of Colt 45 . . . works every time.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t have Luke?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They had everybody--Luke, Obi-Wan, Han Solo--but Dad wouldn&#x2019;t get them because they&#x2019;re white.&#x201d;<br>So now Uzi&#x2019;s in his closet deciding what to take with him to Arizona.<br><br>&#x201c;Make sure you leave this room better than you found it,&#x201d; my dad says, scoping the mess.<br><br>&#x201c;Whateva,&#x201d; Uzi sighs, and tosses a shirt into his duffle.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d you say?&#x201d; My dad moves closer. I see his face clenching, like he wants to slap the shit out of Uzi. He won&#x2019;t, though, because Uzi&#x2019;s his stepson. Now if it were me, I&#x2019;d be ducking haymakers. Uzi steps out of the closet. They&#x2019;re a swing away from each other. My brother, at 6'6", Michael Jordan&#x2019;s height, towers over my pops, who might be 5'7"--Spud Webb. Pops ain&#x2019;t no slouch, though. He&#x2019;s southern stocky, used to chase chickens and wrestle swamp thangs and chop firewood back in the day.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x201d;--Uzi tilts his head like one side weighs more--&#x201c;eva.&#x201d;<br><br>Pops swallows hard. They eye each other down like the cowboys in the black-and-white Westerns my uncle John loves watching--toothpicks plugged into stone faces, beat-up brims, ashy steel toes.<br><br>I love a good fight, but I don&#x2019;t want to see this. One day when Uzi was real mad at my dad, he told me if it ever came down to it, he&#x2019;d fight my pops like &#x201c;a ngh on the street.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t want to see that, and I know deep down Uzi doesn&#x2019;t want that either, but he&#x2019;s a cannon. He&#x2019;s got a Rasheed Wallace temper, so hot you can fry bacon on it.<br><br>&#x201c;Finish packing. Be downstairs ready to go in thirty.

What Collins delivers is a virtual encyclopedia of all things off the grid, covering every conceivable prerequisite to development, cost, planning, consideration, and resources for turning the dream of living autonomously into a reality.<b> - Reviewed By Jamie Michele for Readers' Favorite</b><br>Going Off The Grid is an incredibly informative book about a fascinating topic that is growing in popularity as well as notability. I confess that Going Off The Grid has to be one of the best books in the genre today thanks to its useful and practical knowledge as well as how entertaining of a read it is. You may be thinking "how can a book about living off the grid" be entertaining but trust me when I write that it is. Firstly the incredible author Gary Collins writes beautifully so that you are entertained from start to finish, but as well as this he shares his own experiences (sometimes in a humorous way) and shares stories about his journey to living off the grid and these sections of the book were incredibly entertaining and kept me turning the pages with haste.<br><br>Above all, however, the book is great for all readers as the premise of the book is to help you reevaluate your life and current living situations, make you realize whether you need change and ultimately help you on a path to happier living which is pretty amazing in my opinion.<b> - Reviewed By Red Headed Book Lover</b><b></b><br>"If you are looking at going off grid, READ THIS BOOK FIRST!Gary Collins's book definitely helps navigate through some major wouldbe pitfalls of going off the grid."<br><br><b>(Amazon Verified Purchase)</b><br><br>"One thing that I thought was great about the book was that the authorprovided examples of price ranges.

While any of the episodes stand alone, cumulatively they tell the story of a group of kids who are suckered into entering a terrifying theme park--HorrorLand--and its even scarier twin--Panic Park. There, the children must learn to stand together, forging unlikely allies, if they&#39;re ever to make it out alive. The narrators in each episode deliver convincing accounts of children caught in the spookiest situations, and appropriate sound effects and music ratchet up the experience. Particularly effective is the final episode, in which Suzy Jackson narrates a face-off with the children&#39;s nemesis, played by Marc Thompson. Stine&#39;s skill at fiction that is both scary and child-friendly makes this series an exhilarating ride. F.G. � AudioFile 2010, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary</h2><p>This New York Times Notable Book of the Year, 1998, is now in trade paper. <br><br>From the bestselling author of Eyes on the Prize, here is the definitive biography of the great lawyer and Supreme Court justice.</p><p><i>Washington Post</i> correspondent and TV commentator Juan Williams has produced an illuminating look at a true giant of 20th-century American politics. Williams retells the story of Thurgood Marshall's successful desegregation of public schools in the U.S. with his victory in the case of <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i>, followed by his appointment to the Supreme Court in 1967 for a 24-year term. But he also recounts how W.E.B. Du Bois, then the head of the NAACP, gave a cold shoulder to the younger Marshall (who eventually helped oust Du Bois from the organization), and describes the tug of war between Marshall and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, as well as the mind games Lyndon Johnson played on Marshall before nominating him for the Supreme Court. Readers also learn about Marshall's relationship with his replacement, Clarence Thomas, which was surprisingly civil given their contrary views on affirmative action. Williams has captured many examples of Thurgood Marshall's heroism and humanity in this comprehensive yet readable biography of a complex, combative, and courageous civil rights figure. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i>Times Books editor Jon Karp: A great deal has been written about Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, but as Juan Williams proves in this illuminating biography, the true architect of America's civil rights movement was Thurgood Marshall. It was Marshall who engineered the legal strategy that integrated America's schools, neighborhoods, businesses, and voting booths, and it was his advocacy of affirmative action that gave black Americans entry to places from which they had previously been denied. All of this occurred well before Marshall's ascension to the Supreme Court, on which he served for 25 years, playing a crucial role in a number of the most important legal decisions of our time.<p><br>In other words, Thurgood Marshall is a major American figure who lived at the center of race relations in America for over fifty years. Until now, Marshall has never been the subject of a thoroughly researched biography for general readers, and now, we have the ideal biographer: Juan Williams, a nationally known commentator, Washington Post reporter, Emmy-award winning documentary writer, and best-selling author of EYES ON THE PRIZE. This book is Juan's magnum opus. He's been working on it for the past eight years, interviewed over 150 sources, and conducted over 20 hours of exclusive interviews with Marshall.</p><p> <br>This book is the definitive word on Marshall's life. Juan Williams takes us behind the scenes during all of the important movements in Marshall's career: His early criminal cases, in which he fought to save the lives of innocent black men on death row and developed a life-long opposition to the death penalty; his pioneering desegregation and voting rights cases in Texas; the incredible story of the time he was almost lynched after successfully arguing a case in Mississippi; plus his legendary work on Brown versus The Board of Education; his battle with Bobby Kennedy to secure an appointment as a federal court judge; his negotiations with J. Edgar Hoover, who was an enemy at first and later an important ally, and the inside story of how Marshall helped Hoover uproot communists from the NAACP; and his years on the Supreme Court, where he frustrated conservatives by holding onto his seat and fighting for the disenfranchised longer than anyone ever expected.</p><p><br>While I was reading this book, I realized that there is nobility to Marshall's life. His is a classic inspirational American story, up from nowhere, propelled by will and wit and all the way to the highest levels of power in the United States. This is a sweeping study of an iconic figure in American life, an ordinary man who became extraordinary and changed our history.<br></p></p><h2>Am I Really a Christian?

People have come up with a lot of different ways of thinking about that question&#x2015;ranging from your ability to remember &#x2018;praying the prayer,&#x2019; to possessing a signed card in your Bible from a revival meeting, to ensuring your &#x2018;letter&#x2019; is safely tucked away in some church's filing cabinet. Examining ourselves to make sure we are in the faith is about a whole lot more than that, and McKinley offers good help for that kind of heart evaluation.

People have come up with a lot of different ways of thinking about that question&#x2015;ranging from your ability to remember &#x2018;praying the prayer,&#x2019; to possessing a signed card in your Bible from a revival meeting, to ensuring your &#x2018;letter&#x2019; is safely tucked away in some church's filing cabinet. Examining ourselves to make sure we are in the faith is about a whole lot more than that, and McKinley offers good help for that kind of heart evaluation.

Hundreds were built across the country, from coastal resorts to remote mountains. Through these imaginative forms of concrete and steel, a classless, forward-looking socialist society, free of ethnic tensions, was envisaged. Instead of looking to the ideologically aligned Soviet Union for artistic inspiration, Tito turned to the West and works of abstract expressionism and minimalism. This allowed Yugoslavia to develop its own distinct identity through the monuments, turning them into political tools, articulating Tito's personal vision of a new tomorrow.</p><p>Today, following the breakup of the country and the subsequent Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, some have been destroyed or abandoned.

Outside it is still dark, 15 degrees with 33 inches of snow&#x2014;nearly a December record&#x2014;piled up and drifting as a stinging wind sweeps across the acres of parking lots.<br> <br>Inside the Janesville Assembly Plant, the lights are blazing, and the crowd is thick. Workers who are about to walk out of the plant into uncertain futures stand alongside pensioned retirees who have walked back in, their chests tight with incredulity and nostalgia. All these GM&#x2019;ers have followed the Tahoe as it snakes down the line. They are cheering, hugging, weeping.<br> <br>The final Tahoe is a beauty. It is a black LTZ, fully loaded with heated seats, aluminum wheels, a nine-speaker Bose audio system, and a sticker price of $57,745 if it were going to be for sale in this economy in which almost no one anymore wants to buy a fancy General Motors SUV.<br> <br>Five men, including one in a Santa hat, stand in front of the shiny black SUV holding a wide banner, its white spaces crammed with workers&#x2019; signatures. &#x201c;Last Vehicle off the Janesville Assembly Line,&#x201d; the banner says, with the date, December 23, 2008. It is destined for the county historical society.<br> <br>Television crews from as far away as the Netherlands and Japan have come to film this moment, when the oldest plant of the nation&#x2019;s largest automaker turns out its last.<br> <br>So the closing of the assembly plant, two days before Christmas, is well recorded.<br> <br>This is the story of what happens next.<br> <br><br> <br>Janesville, Wisconsin, lies three fourths of the way from Chicago to Madison along Interstate 90&#x2019;s path across America from coast to coast. It is a county seat of 63,000, built along a bend in the Rock River. And at a spot on the banks where the river narrows sits the assembly plant.<br> <br>General Motors started turning out Chevrolets in Janesville on Valentine&#x2019;s Day of 1923. For eight and a half decades, this factory, like a mighty wizard, ordered the city&#x2019;s rhythms. The radio station synchronized its news broadcasts to the shift change. Grocery prices went up along with GM raises. People timed their trips across town to the daily movements of freight trains hauling in parts and hauling away finished cars, trucks, and SUVs. By the time the plant closed, the United States was in a crushing financial crisis that left a nation strewn with discarded jobs and deteriorated wages. Still, Janesville&#x2019;s people believed that their future would be like their past, that they could shape their own destiny. They had reason for this faith.<br> <br>Long before General Motors arrived, Janesville was an industrious little city, surrounded by the productive farmland of southern Wisconsin. It was named for a settler, Henry Janes, and its manufacturing history began early. A few years before the Civil War, the Rock River Iron Works was making agricultural implements in a complex of buildings along South Franklin Street. By 1870, a local business directory listed fifteen Janesville carriage manufacturers. Along the river, a textile industry thrived&#x2014;wool, then cotton. By 1880, 250 workers, most of them young women, were weaving cloth in the Janesville Cotton Mills.<br> <br>As the twentieth century opened, Janesville was a city of about thirteen thousand&#x2014;descendants of the original settlers from the East Coast and immigrants over the decades from Ireland, Germany, and Norway. Downtown, Franklin and River Streets were lined with factories. Milwaukee and Main Streets were crowded with shops, offices, and, at one point, a saloon for every 250 residents. Stores stayed open on Saturday nights for farm families to come into town once their week&#x2019;s work was done. The bridge that carried Milwaukee Street over the river was still wooden, but electrified streetcars running north and south from downtown had replaced the old horse-drawn trolley service. Janesville was a railroad hub. Each day, sixty-four passenger trains, plus freight trains, pulled in and out of town. Raw materials arrived for factories, politicians for whistle-stop tours, and vaudeville stars for performances at the Myers Grand Opera House.<br> <br>In Janesville&#x2019;s long history of making things, two figures stand out. They are homegrown captains of industry, obscure to most Americans but legend to every Janesville schoolkid. They shaped the city&#x2019;s identity along with its economy.<br> <br>The first was a young telegraphy instructor in town named George S. Parker. In the 1880s, he patented a better fountain pen and formed the Parker Pen Company. Soon, Parker Pen expanded into international markets. Its pens showed up at world leaders&#x2019; treaty signings, at World&#x2019;s Fairs. Parker Pen imbued the city with an outsized reputation and reach. It put Janesville on the map.<br> <br>The second was another savvy businessman, Joseph A. Craig, who made General Motors pay attention to Janesville&#x2019;s talent. Near the close of World War I, he maneuvered to bring GM to town, at first to make tractors. Over the years, the assembly plant grew to 4.8 million square feet, the playing area of ten football fields. It had more than seven thousand workers in its heyday and led to thousands of jobs at nearby companies that supplied parts. If Parker Pen put Janesville on the map, GM kept it there. It proved that Janesville could surmount adversity under trying circumstances, seemingly immune to the blows of history. During the Great Depression, it closed&#x2014;and reopened a year later. During a sitdown strike, a seminal event in U.S. labor history, while autoworkers rioted elsewhere, peace held in Janesville. During World War II, the plant turned out artillery shells as part of the home front before postwar production resumed, greater than ever. Even as the auto industry&#x2019;s fortunes in the 1970s started to fade, dooming other plants, Janesville&#x2019;s assembly line moved on and on.<br> <br>So when the assembly plant stopped on a frozen December morning of 2008, how could people in town have known that this time would be different? Nothing in their past had prepared them to recognize that another comeback would not save them now.<br> <br>The work that vanished&#x2014;as many as nine thousand people lost their jobs in and near this county seat in 2008 and 2009&#x2014;was among 8.8 million jobs washed away in the United States by what came to be known as the Great Recession. This was, of course, not the first moment at which some American communities have hemorrhaged jobs in their defining industries. The textile mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, began to shut down or move to the South as early as World War I. Youngstown, Ohio&#x2019;s, Black Monday of 1977 began to erase an eventual fifty thousand jobs in steel and related industries. But this mighty recession&#x2014;the worst economic time since the 1930s&#x2014;stole American jobs, not in a single industry, not in a cluster of ill-fated communities, but up and down the economic ladder, from the East Coast to the West, in places that had never been part of the Rust Belt or any other bad economic belt and had never imagined that they would be so bruised. Places like Janesville.<br> <br><br> <br>Today, the assembly plant is padlocked behind a chain-link perimeter. Over the portico of the Art Deco main entrance, its logo is visible still. The logo is the outline of three gears, a different design in each one. In the right gear, the GM symbol. In the left, the crest of the United Auto Workers. Between them, a white field shaped like Wisconsin, with a candy pink heart near the bottom where Janesville sits. And in black letters across the top: JANESVILLE PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER. The logo is starting to rust.<br> <br>Inside, the plant is dark. Its innards&#x2014;lathes to welders to five-ton hoists, all the equipment that a dead auto factory no longer needs&#x2014;have been picked over and auctioned off. Outside, the parking lots&#x2019; concrete acres are empty except for a security guard&#x2019;s lone sedan. Against the sky, smokestacks seem to go on forever, spewing nothing at all.<br> <br>Out back, nature has reclaimed an expanse where the rows of gleaming SUVs used to be parked before they were shipped away&#x2014;fields now, with saplings sprouting up. At the back entrance, a small sign is perched atop a guard&#x2019;s gate, missing a few letters: T FOR HE MEMORIES.<br> <br>Without its assembly plant, Janesville goes on, its surface looking uncannily intact for a place that has been through an economic earthquake. Keeping up appearances, trying to hide the ways that pain is seeping in, is one thing that happens when good jobs go away and middle-class people tumble out of the middle class. Along Racine Street, the route from the Interstate to the center of town, little American flags flutter from every street lamp. Main Street, with its nineteenth-century buildings of red and Milwaukee cream brick, retains its architectural grace. That some of its storefronts are vacant is nothing new; the mall began pulling business away from downtown in the 1970s. A recent Heart of the City Outdoor Art Campaign has splashed large pastel murals on the sides of downtown buildings, each mural commemorating one of Janesville&#x2019;s first decades, from its founding in 1836. The mural on the back of City Hall, illustrating the coming of the railroad through town in the 1850s, has a steam locomotive and a spike-driving man, and, lettered across the bottom, &#x201c;History. Vision. Grit.&#x201d;<br> <br>So Janesville goes on, yet it is altered. The change can be glimpsed from the many &#x201c;For Sale&#x201d; signs that appeared along residential streets, from the payday loan franchises that opened along the Milton Avenue commercial drag running north from downtown, from the enlarged space now occupied by the Salvation Army Family Center.<br> <br>And the citizens of Janesville? They set out to reinvent their town and themselves. Over a few years, it became evident that no one outside&#x2014;not the Democrats nor the Republicans, not the bureaucrats in Madison or in Washington, not the fading unions nor the struggling corporations&#x2014;had the key to create the middle class anew. The people of Janesville do not give up. And not just the autoworkers. From the leading banker to the social worker devoted to sheltering homeless kids, people take risks for one another, their affection for their town keeping them here.<br> <br>It is hard. The deserted assembly plant embodies their dilemma: How do you forge a future&#x2014;how do you even comprehend that you need to let go of the past&#x2014;when the carcass of a 4.8-million-square-foot cathedral of industry still sits in silence on the river&#x2019;s edge?<br> <br>Still, people cling to Janesville&#x2019;s can-do spirit. A month before the assembly plant closed, its managers and its United Auto Workers local announced together that the last Tahoe would be donated to the United Way of North Rock County and raffled off for charity. So many tickets, at $20 apiece or six for $100, were sold, so many of them to laid-off workers who didn&#x2019;t have a clue where their next paycheck would come from, that the raffle raised $200,460, pushing the United Way&#x2019;s annual campaign above its goal in the depths of the recession.<br> <br>The winning ticket went to a GM retiree who had worked at the plant for thirty-seven years and has so cherished the Tahoe that it seldom leaves his garage.</p><h2>Ice Cream Summer</h2><p><b>*"S�s delivers an encomium to summer, to the power of learning, and to that beloved, creamy-cold treat." --<i>Kirkus</i>, starred review<br>Savor summer anytime with this breezy, sweet and irresistible picture book from Hans Christian Anderson Award winner and three-time Caldecott Honoree Peter S�s!</b><br><br><i><br><br>Dear Grandpa,<br><br>Summer is going well.

She divides her time between Rignac, France, and New York City.Kindergarten-Grade 4?Three of the most charming picture books to come along in recent years have been made available in book-on-tape format. All are of superior quality with strong narration. In Feast for 10 by Cathryn Falwell, the numbers one through ten are used to illustrate the story of a cheerful, extended family as they shop for and cook their dinner. Rain Player by David Wisniewski, the dramatic tale of Pik, who challenges the rain god to a game of pok-a-tok to save his drought-ridden village, comes to life with wonderfully intense narration. The best of the three new releases in this series is Tap Tap by Karen Lynn Williams, the story about a young Haitian girl who accompanies her mother to the market to sell oranges. They have to walk because Sasifi's mother can't afford to pay for them to ride the tap-tap (bus), so named because passengers tap on the side of the bus to tell the driver to stop. Circumstances finally allow them to ride the bus home. The narration by Margarita Taylor is superlative, with her rich, vibrant voice making you feel as if you are actually in Haiti.

They matter on a personal level, providing us with unforgettable moments, even life-changing experiences and they can confront us, too, with the most profound social issues of race, sex and class. Here bell hooks &#x2013; one of America&#x2019;s most celebrated and thrilling cultural critics &#x2013; talks back to films that have moved and provoked her, from Quentin Tarantino&#x2019;s <em>Pulp Fiction</em> to the work of Spike Lee. Including also her conversations with master filmmakers such as Charles Burnett and Julie Dash, <em>Reel to Real</em> is a must read for anyone who believes that movies are worth arguing about.</p></p><p>bell hooks (b. 1951) is mainly known as a feminist thinker, although her writings cover a broad range of topics on gender, race, education and the media. She is Distinguished Professor of English at City College in New York.Hooks's essays on film are not film criticism: they are criticism of culture as viewed through the prism of film. This mix of theory, reality, popular art and popular criticism (reviews and public reaction play a large part in her discussions) is effective in forcing a rethinking of the films in question. A reading of reviews of Exotica shows that only the strip-joint portions of the movie were considered worthy of commentary. Quentin Tarantino?a filmmaker "not afraid to publicly pimp his wares"?is taken to task for ingesting superficial aspects of black culture and spitting out the rest. The "mock feminism" of Waiting to Exhale ("an utterly boring show") is exposed as hooks examines differences between the book and the movie. The essays that do not focus on a single film are equally successful: a discussion of the black female gaze recalls that slaves could be punished for looking, and another on representations of black masculinity notes that in movies with two male leads, one black and one white, such as Rising Sun, the white man plays the "father" role. The essays could have benefited from more thoughtful organization. Hooks refers to her first-ever film-related essay, on Spike Lee's She's Gotta Have It, in her introduction and elsewhere, but the essay does not appear until the final pages of the book. A piece on the accountability of filmmakers that involves Wayne Wang would have matched up nicely with a dialogue with Wang, which instead is sandwiched in a group of interviews with Arthur Jaffa, Camille Billops and the like. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Grow Your Own Herbs: The 40 Best Culinary Varieties for Home Gardens</h2><p><b>Nothing tastes better than herbs harvested fresh from the garden!</b><br><br><i>Grow Your Own Herbs</i> shares everything you need to know to grow the forty most important culinary herbs.&nbsp;You&#x2019;ll learn basic gardening information, including details on soil, watering, and potting.

In his early days of rock collecting, fellow geologists said that he would get over the excitement from finding an interesting rock, but that never happened. He majored in geology at California State University, Chico and his first rock collecting trips focused on the northern Sierra Nevada and southern California desert. He received his B.A. in geology, with a minor in mathematics from CSUC in 1983. He then attended the University of New Mexico as a graduate student in geology, and spent considerable time looking for rocks in New Mexico's mountains and deserts. He worked briefly for a mining company as part of an exploration team during his first summer in New Mexico, and got to see many different types of mineral deposits and geologic terrains, and developed a keen understanding minerals and how to find them. He received his M.S. degree in geology from UNM in 1987, at a time when the mining and oil industries were flat on their backs, but the environmental cleanup industry was just getting started. In 1988 he moved to the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area to pursue a career as an environmental geologist. Since then he has remained alert for opportunities to see geology and collect rocks, minerals, and fossils, as he was taught that the best geologist is the one that has the most rocks. He has collected rocks throughout most regions of the United States and parts of the Caribbean, and the past few years he was focused on finding new collecting sites in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. He is a Contributing Editor to Rock &amp; Gem magazine, and has written from Rock &amp; Gem since 1993. He also speaks Spanish, which has been a very useful skill for geology, especially when working in Spanish-speaking environments. He currently lives in Harrisburg, PA with his wife, Rosalina, and his two children, Daniel and Roberta.</p><h2>Biblical Church Revitalization: Solutions for Dying &amp; Divided Churches (Practical Shepherding)</h2><p><p>There is a unique and special power and testimony in not just a vibrant local church full of life, but an old historic one that had lost its way, was on life support, and into which God saw fit to breathe life once again. <i>Biblical Church Revitalization</i> calls us to an intentional commitment to church revitalization in the face of dying and divided churches.</p></p><p>Brian Croft is Senior Pastor of Auburndale Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky and is the Founder of Practical Shepherding.

Mosaic pavements with geometric and figural motifs first appeared in Greece at the end of the fifth century BC and subsequently spread throughout the classical world, from the palaces of emperors and kings to even relatively modest private homes. Across the Mediterranean, local workshops cultivated many distinctive regional styles, while traveling teams of Hellenistic craftsmen produced figural mosaics of stunning refinement, often modeled after famous paintings; indeed, their work constitutes one of our only records of classical Greek painting, which has been almost entirely lost.<br>&nbsp;<br>The styles and techniques of the ancient mosaicist&#x2019;s art are given a concise yet authoritative exposition in the first part of this handsome volume. The second, and larger, part conducts the reader on a chronologically ordered tour of the most important centers of the art form&#x2019;s development, from the Macedonian capital of Pella, whose compositions in natural pebbles set a high artistic standard for mosaics at the beginning of their history, to the Basilica of San Vitale at Ravenna, whose wall and vault mosaics, with their glittering vision of a triumphant Christianity, mark the transition between antiquity and the Middle Ages. Special attention is given to Pompeii and its surroundings, where the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 preserved intact an astonishing variety of mosaics, including such ambitious figural scenes as the famous Alexander Mosaic, composed of some four million miniscule tesserae, as well as characteristically Roman pavements in black and white, and the brightly colored wall mosaics of garden grottoes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Featuring more than 230 vibrant photographs, many newly commissioned, <i>Greek and Roman Mosaics</i> is the first survey of its subject to be illustrated in full color. It will be an essential visual reference for every student of classical antiquity, and a source of considerable delight for art lovers.</p><p><b>Umberto Pappalardo</b> has served as Inspector of Excavations at Pompeii and Director of Excavations at Herculaneum, and is professor of classical archaeology at Suor Orsola Benincasa University in Naples.

It's a weird time to fall in love, but that's what happens to Skim when she starts meeting secretly with her neo-hippie English teacher, Ms. Archer. But then Ms. Archer abruptly leaves the school, and Skim has to cope with her confusion and isolation while her best friend, Lisa, tries to pull her into "real" life by setting up a hilarious double-date for the school's semi formal.

Some pages flaunt over 10 similarly sized and shaped panels while others reveal only one (often silent) borderless image. The overall effect reveals impressive artwork and many powerful scenes...Skim is a unique piece, one not to be missed. Highly Recommended. [Skim uses] high school as a fertile setting for pungent commentary on racial, cultural, and sexual issues...The narrative, mainly in diary form, feels accurate and realistic, drenched in a sense of confusion and nihilism, and the art, influenced by Craig Thompson's Blankets (2003), reflects the spare, gloomy emotional landscape in which Skim exists.

It's a story that deepens with successive rereadings. But what will teenagers think? Maybe that they've found a bracingly honest story by a writer who seems to remember exactly what it was like to be 16 and in love for the first time.

Skim is a funny, poignant, memorable drama of navigating adolescence.

Evans), Ian Kershaw&#x2019;s <em>Hitler</em> is a one-volume masterpiece that will become the standard work. From Hitler&#x2019;s origins as a failed artist in fin-de-siecle Vienna to the terrifying last days in his Berlin bunker, Kershaw&#x2019;s richly illustrated biography is a mesmerizing portrait of how Hitler attained, exercised, and retained power. Drawing on previously untapped sources, such as Goebbels&#x2019;s diaries, Kershaw addresses the crucial questions about the unique nature of Nazi radicalism, about the Holocaust, and about the poisoned European world that allowed Hitler to operate so effectively. 151 photos; 8 maps</p><p><p>Front Flap<br>&nbsp;In this now classic account, Ian Kershaw takes an innovative approach to the Hitler story. By putting forward the idea of Hitler as a 'charismatic leader'&nbsp;Kershaw tries to find answers to the questions of why Hitler of all the nationalist-racist fanatics with roughly similar views in Germany after the First World War should find such appeal, how such an unlikely figure as Hitler could come to wield such extraordinary personalised power, what his personal role in the shaping of policy amounted to, and whether he was indeed personally directing policy and taking the key decisions down to the very end.&nbsp;Hitler is portayed by Kershaw as a social product, not a demonic figure. He is depicted as the product of a society at a particular conjuncture - a society gripped by an extraordinary and comprehensive crisis of values, an overwhelming cultural as well as political, social and economic crisis. In the fourteen years that follwed the end of the First World War, he gradually emerged as the mouthpiece of the nationalist masses and&nbsp;eventually transformed himself into what over thirteen million Germans saw as the hope of national salvation.&nbsp;Ian Kershaw&nbsp;offers original insights into&nbsp;how Hitler 'became possible' and paints a compelling portrait of dictatorial power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Back Flap<br><br><b>Ian Kershaw</b> is Professor of Modern History at the University of Sheffield.

Having spent years building tanks and airplanes for the army, the car companies would need years more to retool their production to meet the demands of the American public, for whom they had not made any cars since 1942.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> And then in stepped Preston Tucker. This salesman extraordinaire from Ypsilanti, Michigan, had built race cars before the war, and had designed prototypes for the military during it. Now, gathering a group of brilliant automotive designers, engineers, and promoters, he announced the creation of a revolutionary new car: the Tucker '48, the first car in almost a decade to be built fresh from the ground up. Tucker's car would include ingenious advances in design and engineering that other car companies could not match. With a rear engine, rear-wheel drive, a safety-glass windshielf that would pop out in case of an accident, a padded dashboard, independent suspension, and automatic transmission, it would be more attractive and aerodynamic&#x2014;and safer&#x2014;than any other car on the road.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But as the public eagerly awaited Tucker's car of tomorrow, powerful forces in Washington were trying to bring him down. An SEC commissioner with close ties to Detroit's Big Three automakers deliberately leaked information about an investigation the agency was conducting, suggesting that Tucker was bilking investors with a massive fraud scheme. Headlines accused him a perpetrating a hoax and claimed that his cars weren't real and his factory was a sham.&nbsp;<br><br> In fact, the Tucker '48 sedan was genuine, and everyone who saw it was impressed by what this upstart carmaker had achieved. But the SEC's investigation had compounded the company's financial problems and management conflicts, and a superior product was not enough to keep Tucker's dream afloat.&nbsp;<br><br> Here, Steve Lehto tackles the story of Tucker's amazing rise and tragic fall, relying on a huge trove of documents that has been used by no other writer to date. It is the first comprehensive, authoritative account of Tucker's magnificent car and his battles with the government. And in this book, Lehto finally answers the questions automobile aficionados have wondered about for decades: Exactly how and why was the production of such an innovative car killed?</p><p><b>Steve Lehto</b> is the author of <i>Chrysler&#x2019;s Turbine Car</i>, <i>Death&#x2019;s Door</i><i>, Drawn to Injustice</i>, and <i>The Great American Jet Pack</i>, among others.

This book is the story of what she discovered&#x2015;and of how her search for answers became a journey toward a life of less stress and more leisure.<br> Schulte's findings are illuminating, puzzling, and, at times, maddening: Being overwhelmed is even affecting the size of our brains. But she also encounters signs of real progress&#x2015;evidence that what the ancient Greeks called "the good life" is attainable after all. Schulte talks to companies who are inventing a new kind of workplace; travels to countries where policies support office cultures that don't equate shorter hours with laziness (and where people actually get more done); meets couples who have figured out how to share responsibilities. Enlivened by personal anecdotes, humor, and hope, <i>Overwhelmed</i> is a book about modern life&#x2015;a revelation of the misguided beliefs and real stresses that have made leisure feel like a thing of the past, and of how we can find time for it in the present.</p></p><p>This is an accidental book, and surely friends who knew me growing up - and waited as I burst into places late, trailing shoes and socks or a toothbrush - guffawed heartily when they heard I was working on a book about time. It all started with a phone call. I was part of a group of journalists at the Washington Post asked to research why fewer and fewer women under the age of 50 were reading the newspaper. The journalists, all of us women, most of us caretakers of some kind - mothers, guardians for nieces and nephews, daughters of aging parents - figured women were just too busy. After all, we sometimes found it hard to find the uninterrupted time to read the very newspaper we worked for in the swirl of morning craziness. My assignment was to find the time study data to prove how busy women are. Knowing nothing about time research, I googled, &#34;busy women time&#34; and up popped someone by the name of John Robinson, one of the first and most eminent time-use researchers in the world. I called him up, expecting to find easy validation. Instead, he told me women like me had 30 hours of leisure time every week. And thus the journey began."Once, my sister, Claire told me that when you smile, it releases some chemical in the brain and calms anxiety. I have tried smiling. At 4 A.M. In bed. In the dark."<br>Overwhelmed is a book about time pressure and modern life. And it comes at the perfect moment: Amid debates about the toll of work and life demands on parents and our addiction to the daily grind, <i>Overwhelmed </i>is just what we need to address our questions about work, love, and play. Brigid Schulte, an award-winning journalist for <i>The Washington Post </i>and a harried mother of two, began her journey to rediscover leisure when she realized her life was becoming "like the dream I keep having about trying to run a race wearing ski boots." She goes from the depths of the "time confetti" of her days to an understanding of what the ancient Greeks knew was the point of living a good life: having time to refresh the soul in leisure. What Schulte finds is illuminating, perplexing, and maddening, but ultimately hopeful. <i>Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time </i>is a book with answers.<br>Taking the baton from such pathbreakers as Barbara Ehrenreich, Arlie Hochschild's <i>The Second Shift</i>, and Juliet Schor's <i>The Overworked American</i>, Schulte details not only the intensifying pressures on women, and increasingly on men, but also how feeling overwhelmed is affecting our health and even the size of our brains. At times, the author becomes her own subject, as when she sits in a Paris auditorium crammed with scholars, jet-lagged and hungry, and dozes off--until a speaker lamenting the toll of "role overload" on working parents snaps her awake.<br>She visits Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the renowned anthropologist, who presents hard evidence that women are not "wired" for child care--so a "natural" family arrangement might actually include heavy involvement on the father's part. It's a model that's taken root not only among the hunter-gatherer tribes in the Kalahari Desert that Hrdy has studied, but also in Denmark, the world's happiest country, where it's possible to work short, productive, flexible hours and&nbsp;still be successful, committed workers and attentive&nbsp;parents--and have time for leisure. <i>Overwhelmed </i>is both a map of the stresses that&nbsp;have ripped our leisure to shreds and a blueprint for how to put the pieces back together. What Schulte offers us is a revelatory, at times hilarious, and at heart optimistic view of how we can begin to find time for the things that matter most, and live more fulfilled lives.</p><h2>The Total Depravity of Man</h2><p>Arthur Walkington Pink was an English Christian evangelist and biblical scholar who was known for his staunchly Calvinist and Puritan-like teachings in an era dominated by opposing theological traditions.

P. David Pearson, University of California, Berkeley, and founding editor of the Handbook of Reading Research.</p> <p><i>Reading for Understanding</i> is a monumental achievement. It was a monumental achievement when it came out as a first edition in 1999, bringing years of rigorous reading research together in a framework for teaching that made sense in actual secondary school classrooms.

Don&#x2019;t be so fast to believe everything you hear! In this book Dr. Jason Lisle examines 420 claims of Bible contradictions and sets the record straight.</p> <br> Contradiction #139 <br> Was Abraham justified by faith or by works? <strong>Romans 4:2</strong> - says <em>by faith</em> VS. <strong>James 2:21</strong> - says <em>by works</em><p></p> <p>Bifurcation fallacy. Abraham was justified both by faith and by works (James 2:24, 26). To &#x201c;justify&#x201d; means either to be in right moral standing or to show that one is (morally) in right standing. Abraham was justified by faith before God since God knows all things including Abraham&#x2019;s faith (James 2:23). God sees our hearts (1 Samuel 16:7), so we are justified before God by our faith alone, which God can see. But men cannot see another man&#x2019;s faith. They only see the outward works that follow from inward faith. Therefore, Abraham was justified before men by the works that followed from his faith, since men cannot see faith but can see works. James explicitly teaches this (James 2:18 26).</p></p><p><p>Dr. Jason Lisle is a Christian astrophysicist who writes and speaks on various topics relating to science and the defense of the Christian faith.

If so, that would explain some amazing stories.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST&#x2014;AND PRESEN</b>T<br> &nbsp;<br> The house was packed at the upscale Urban Zen in New York City, where Cameron Diaz was guest of honor at an event hosted by the David Lynch Foundation. Looking as radiant as ever, Diaz, a regular TM practitioner, was dressed casually in black, her blond hair swept across her cheek, as she engaged warmly with the audience about her experiences with TM&#x2014;such as this one:<br> &nbsp;<br> It was about ninety degrees in the Valley, at the Los Angeles Zoo parking lot, under a tent, in a car, under lights, with the windows up and no air<b>-</b>conditioning. It was about a thousand degrees in the car. And I had a monologue and I couldn&#x2019;t remember my lines&#x2014;lines that I knew. I knew I knew them. I&#x2019;d said them a million times, and I couldn&#x2019;t access them. They&#x2019;re completely lost in . . . wherever they go. And I realized all of a sudden, I went, &#x201c;No, I need twenty<b>-</b>five minutes. I just need twenty<b>-</b>five minutes.&#x201d; I ran back to my trailer and I rebooted. I did my twenty-minute meditation. And I came back to the car and I could see all those poor grip guys&#x2014;they&#x2019;re all sweating, holding heavy equipment. They&#x2019;re looking at me like, &#x201c;I hate you. Get your lines right, woman, so we can get out of here.&#x201d; I mean really like the evil eye. And I didn&#x2019;t want to let them down, and I wanted to be able to do my lines. But after I had gone back to my trailer and rebooted, I came back and I nailed it. I was like, <i>Done, thank you very much. </i>And we were out of there, I have to say, in like twenty minutes. <br> &nbsp;<br> Diaz held the audience at Urban Zen spellbound as she described the power of TM as a technique for mining memory.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her description of retrieving her lost lines is at once foreign (After all, how many of us have been on a movie set at the Los Angeles Zoo?) and scarily familiar. How often have you searched for a word, telephone number, or the first line of a familiar poem, only to find that it is . . . sometimes there and . . . sometimes not. We are left asking: where did it go and how can we bring it back?<br> &nbsp;<br> Diaz&#x2019;s story also resonates because most of us have a sense that our brains hold a vast storehouse of buried treasure, and that if we could only unearth it more efficiently, we&#x2019;d be far better off. It is this sense, perhaps, that has led to the urban myth (thoroughly debunked) that we use only 10 percent of our brains (though many are the self<b>-</b>help tomes that promise to unlock the missing 90 percent for the price of a few lattes). Although these percentages seem silly to anyone with even a modest knowledge of the brain, the idea contains a germ of truth that has perhaps given traction to the myth: we <i>do </i>have untapped potential, so perhaps we <i>can </i>be smarter than we think.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although nobody can say for sure why a person forgets something at one moment, then remembers it later, we do know that stress can affect memory in ways both good and bad, and we have some ideas about the underlying brain structures at work. In fact, once again our old friend the prefrontal cortex (PFC) appears to be involved. Studies in animals have shown that specific neurochemical pathways, when activated by excess stress, cause profound impairment of the PFC.1 Specifically, too much dopamine and norepinephrine are implicated. By reducing stress, TM may lower the concentrations of these two key neurotransmitters in the PFC, thereby improving cognitive functions&#x2014;such as remembering lost lines in a movie script. <br> &nbsp;<br> This effect of improved brain function when stress is reduced may remind some of you of the so<b>-</b>called inverted U<b>-</b>shaped curve, which shows how small amounts of stress or anxiety can boost performance but large amounts can make it worse. If you consider the declining limb of the inverted U (that part of the curve where anxiety is increasing but performance is decreasing), it is easy to see how TM could decrease stress and reduce key neurotransmitters in the PFC, thereby making the brain work better.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whatever brain mechanisms were at work on that memorable day at the LA Zoo, we will never know. But the bottom line is that twenty minutes of TM restored Cameron Diaz&#x2019;s memory rapidly and completely. She had instinctively reached for the right remedy, and it worked.<br> &nbsp;<br> Many other performers who practice TM have recommended doing meditation before tackling a stressful task. Megan Fairchild, principal dancer for the New York City Ballet, does her TM before every performance, as does Tony Award&#x2013;winning actress Katie Finneran. So does actor, singer, and dancer Hugh Jackman, who says: &#x201c;I meditated before I hosted the Oscars. I meditate before I go onstage. I meditate in the morning and lunchtime when I&#x2019;m on a film set. It&#x2019;s like it resets.&#x201d; And director Martin Scorsese routinely meditates before facing another grueling day on the movie set.<br> &nbsp;<br> But here is an obvious fact: You don&#x2019;t have to be well-known or a performer for TM to work. Anybody who has learned TM can take advantage of these observations. I can imagine an architect, schoolteacher, first responder, librarian&#x2014;anyone, really&#x2014;benefiting from TM at the start of the day. If you are a regular meditator, you are already at an advantage because the stillness of the Super Mind is already part of you, residing alongside your everyday activities. And if a crisis comes up, you can expand that advantage by taking a TM time<b>-</b>out.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION: ADHD AND THE SUPER MIND</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Before leaving the topic of memory, let&#x2019;s consider a few other examples of improved memory apparently resulting from TM. A woman friend of mine, a medical student, has found that TM greatly improves her ability to remember the volumes of information her course work requires&#x2014;but for a different reason. She has been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, a condition that makes it hard to maintain focus. As you can imagine, if you have trouble focusing on something, you will not do well at remembering it. Problems with attention interfere with both storage and retrieval of memory. One benefit of TM has been to still her overactive mind&#x2014;even when she is not meditating&#x2014;which has helped her focus better and thereby be more successful in retaining what she studies.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although there have been no large controlled studies of TM specifically for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at this time, one small pilot study on ten distractible students between the ages of eleven and fourteen was conducted by Sarina Grosswald, Bill Stixrud, and colleagues at a school in the Washington, D.C., area.2 Although the study was small and uncontrolled, its results drew rave reviews from the staff, who observed that the students not only concentrated better but were less impulsive. One boy, for example, who could barely sit still in his chair at the beginning of the study, was able to concentrate long enough to read an entire book&#x2014;to the astonishment of his mother. Another boy told Bill Stixrud, a D.C.<b>-</b>area neuropsychologist and longtime TM practitioner, &#x201c;Before learning TM, when someone would bump into me in the hall, I would hit him. Now I ask myself, &#x2018;Should I hit him or not?&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In a separate controlled study, Fred Travis and colleagues investigated the effects of TM on the EEG in eighteen students, ages eleven to fourteen, who had been diagnosed with ADHD .3 In prior work on ADHD in adolescents, it had been established that the severity of symptoms is highly correlated with a certain EEG function known as the theta/beta ratio (a simple ratio between two EEG wavelengths): the worse the symptoms, the higher the ratio.4 In the study by Travis and colleagues, the eighteen students were randomly assigned to practice TM or wait for three months before learning TM. Their EEGs were measured at the start of the study and at the end of three months (just before the controls learned TM). As predicted, the researchers found that the theta/beta ratios in the TM group declined significantly over the first three months compared to the control group (see figure 6 below). Once the control group learned TM (after three months), its theta/beta ratios also declined.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bottom line: the effects of TM on both ADHD symptoms and the EEG are apparent after three months of practice. <br> &nbsp;<br><b> THIS CRAZY WORLD OF OURS</b><br> &nbsp;<br> You don&#x2019;t need a formal diagnosis of ADHD, however, to lose focus in a world that offers so many distractions. As one of my friends puts it, &#x201c;These days I think we all have a little ADHD.&#x201d; The old adage, &#x201c;More haste, less speed,&#x201d; is part of the problem. In our attempts to &#x201c;multitask,&#x201d; we often get less done, not more. But inefficiency in multitasking may be the least of our worries. Worse still is a common tendency to sacrifice essentials when we try to juggle less important things at the same time&#x2014;like making sure that the text we are sending our BFF (best friend forever) is sufficiently witty while driving through a red light. When you multitask, you lose perspective&#x2014;a potentially fatal mistake. Research shows that we <i>think </i>we can multitask and stay effective, but we&#x2019;re wrong. The fragmentary attention paid to each task makes it more likely that no task gets done correctly. And that&#x2019;s where the Super Mind comes in: It slows us down, making us less frantic while sharpening our alertness and focus. The result is improved concentration and ability to prioritize.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bill Stixrud rails against the &#x201c;mind<b>-</b>racing, mind<b>-</b>scattering, and mind-numbing effects of our extensive use of technology&#x201d; that he sees in his daily practice. He adds, &#x201c;We need to build in antidotes to constant stimulation, and TM is a hugely important antidote.&#x201d; He knows this not only from clinical observation but from his own experience. Here&#x2019;s how he describes it: <br> &nbsp;<br> As I meditate, I remember what&#x2019;s important. Sometimes I think I should stop my program early to take care of urgent matters, but then I realize that there will be time to take care of everything, and the most important thing is for me to finish my meditation. As I do so, things sort themselves out in my mind and fall into better perspective. It always pays for me not to interrupt my meditation, but to see it through and reap its rewards.<br> &nbsp;<br> On a personal level, I can&#x2019;t believe how nowadays I can usually locate my cell phone and other important objects that once would have gone astray in a fog of distraction. While my ability to retrieve lost objects is still far from stellar, somehow I am more attentive and less often mislay them. Also, I enjoy slowing down enough to do things properly. It feels less frenetic, more satisfying. We will explore the issue of attentiveness further when we address the relationship between transcendence and mindfulness in chapter 14.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> WORKING MEMORY</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Even working memory, which many regard as difficult to improve, may yield to the powers of TM, as evidenced in a patient of mine, David, a successful businessman. David has always prided himself on his excellent working memory&#x2014;a function required, for example, to remember a telephone number long enough to find a pencil (Where did that pencil go? I know it was here just a minute ago!) and write the number down. David came to me because he was depressed, and I treated him with antidepressants and psychotherapy. After a few months, both he and I considered him fully recovered in every way&#x2014;except for his working memory, which had previously been excellent. Now his memory was perfectly adequate for everyday life, but when it came to remembering long strings of numbers for short intervals, he realized he had lost his old talent&#x2014;until he learned TM. Within the first few weeks of practice, his memory skill came back, and the timing of its welcome return coincided exactly with his starting to meditate.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> REMEMBERING THINGS YOU DON&#x2019;T KNOW YOU&#x2019;VE FORGOTTEN</b><br> &nbsp;<br> My last example of the beneficial effects of TM practice on memory is quite unusual. How often have you remembered something that you didn&#x2019;t know you had forgotten? That actually happened to a friend of mine who, along with her husband, had traded in their old car for a new one two days before the event I&#x2019;m about to describe. Both highly competent professionals, they had methodically swept through the old car (once at home and once at the garage) and removed all trash and debris, as well as everything they wanted to keep&#x2014;or so they thought. Two days later, while doing her morning TM, my friend suddenly remembered the E<b>-</b>Z Pass attached to the windshield, hidden behind the rearview mirror&#x2014;and still in the car. It was a job to retrieve it, but well worthwhile to prevent further expenses from accruing. <br> &nbsp;<br> I find this story a good example of Super Mind functioning because it is a simple and clear illustration of how things sometimes surface during meditation that elude us in the clear light of day. As the Super Mind develops, such insights occur more frequently even outside TM sessions. This story is a good bridge to our next section, on creativity, a function that depends in part on the unexpected insights and novel connections that arise unbidden and mysteriously, and may be critically important to solving problems.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> THE SUPER MIND AND CREATIVITY</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Creativity is intelligence having fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; --</i>source unknown<br> &nbsp;<br> One highly prized aspect of intellectual functioning that many of us would love to cultivate is creativity. And certainly many creative people seem drawn to TM&#x2014;raising the question of how this practice, <i>and </i>the resulting Super Mind, might contribute to creative development. By &#x201c;creative&#x201d; I mean having the ability to make unexpected connections, either to see commonplace things in new ways&#x2014;or unusual things that escape the attention of others&#x2014;and realize their importance. The next phase in the creative process is the audacity to hold on to this new realization&#x2014;often in the face of opposition or ridicule&#x2014;and then pursue and realize the idea despite obstacles. <br> &nbsp;<br>I have had the good fortune to discuss creativity with some highly accomplished and creative TM practitioners. To a person, they credit TM with making them more creative&#x2014;at timesdramatically so. Among others, I interviewed the great classical guitarist and longtime TM practitioner Sharon Isbin.

After the first edition of the book was used to catechize tens of thousands seeking to become Catholic, this second edition was revised in the light of notes made by numerous Catholic priests who had used the text. So it represents the fruit of extensive experience in teaching the Faith to converts, and for years it was practically the standard catechism in the U.S. and Canada for that purpose.</p><p>This book is packed with facts and written in short, clear, question-and-answer format, accompanied by brief Scripture quotes. Using concise, ordinary language to explain profound theological and moral truths, it examines:</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what we must believe and do to be saved</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to form a correct conscience</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the duties of Catholic spouses and parents</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; common mortal sins</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the interior design of a traditional Catholic church</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to pray the Rosary</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; popular saints&#x2019; names for Baptism and Confirmation</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; familiar Catholic prayers</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; practical points for responding to common questions that arise in an unbelieving world.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>A Brief Catechism for Adults</b> is a valuable handbook for becoming a faithful Catholic &#x2014; perfect for inquirers, but excellent for cradle Catholics as well.&nbsp;</p></p><p>The Rev. Father William J. Cogan was a priest and author of the twentieth century, serving the diocese of Chicago. His <i>A Brief Catechism for Adults: A Complete Handbook on How to be a Good Catholic</i> was first published in 1951, receiving the Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur around 1958. Father Cogan's brief but comprehensive work was designed for the instruction of converts, and was compiled from the numerous notes of other priests. The book was also reprinted by TAN in 1993 with additional material.</p><h2>Social Work Practice with Children (Clinical Practice with Children, Adolescents, and Families)</h2><p>A leading course text and practitioner resource for over 20 years--now revised and updated--this book presents developmentally and culturally informed methods for helping children in family, school, and community settings.

She is a recipient of honors including the Day-Garrett Award from the Smith College School for Social Work, the Clinical Practice Award from the Association for Death Education and Counseling, and the designation of Distinguished Scholar by the National Academies of Practice in Social Work."I think the best social work practice with children is grounded in knowledge of both classic sources (such as Selma Fraiberg) and up-to-date research (for example, in modern developmental neuroscience). The fourth edition of Webb's text exemplifies that integration of the best from then and now. It offers the aspiring practitioner a guidebook steeped in wisdom and research."--James Garbarino, PhD, Maude C. Clarke Chair in Humanistic Psychology, Loyola University Chicago<br><br> "In this fourth edition of <i>Social Work Practice with Children,</i> Webb not only updates the essential knowledge base presented in previous editions, but also provides important information on how to address such issues as gender identity struggles, immigration, and trauma from exposure to global violence. Combining theory with vivid examples that demonstrate concrete skills for working with children and families, the book reflects our increasing understanding of the importance of neuroscience and evidence-based research. It belongs on the bookshelf of every social work student and practitioner looking for effective ways to help children today."--Shulamith Lala Ashenberg Straussner, PhD, LCSW, Silver School of Social Work, New York University<br><br> "Webb&#x2019;s classic text, now in its fourth edition, continues to increase practitioners&#x2019; wisdom about how kids' lives are affected by trauma and chronic stress, and how to help them and their families."--Charles Figley, PhD, Kurzweg Chair in Disaster Mental Health, Tulane University School of Social Work<br><br> "Like earlier editions, the fourth edition of this text provides a wealth of empirical information as well as clinical insights into working with children. It is filled with interesting and varied cases that highlight the breadth of child clients and the issues they face. I appreciate the new chapter on immigrant and refugee children."--Julie Anne Laser-Maira, MSW, LCSW, PhD, Graduate School of Social Work, University of Denver<br><br> "As mental health first responders, school mental health professionals work hard to meet students where they're at. The updated fourth edition of this classic text focuses on the all-important, one-on-one encounter between social workers and children, and offers a wealth of strategies and frameworks to do this work well. Particularly welcome is new content related to youth dealing with gender identity issues and updated content related to childhood trauma. Social work students will appreciate the attention to DSM-5 and the numerous ways to directly apply the ideas in the text in their field settings."--Michael S. Kelly, PhD, LCSW, Professor and Director, School Mental Health Advanced Practice Program, Loyola University Chicago School of Social Work<br><br> "This book will inspire creative therapists of all disciplines to practice in a way informed by contemporary social, cultural, economic, and political transformations. The fourth edition highlights clinical tools and formats for addressing modern issues affecting children, such as poverty, violence, immigration, gender identity issues, terrorism, and demographic shifts. It includes crisis principles and insightful considerations regarding how to situate creative and other therapies within a crisis team response. Creative therapists need not only to hone their clinical skills, but also to deliver care thoughtfully and effectively in the multiple contexts of a child&#x2019;s life, including the home, school, and community. Nancy Boyd Webb guides practitioners to do just that."--Sarah C. Patton, PsyD, Primary Therapist, The Renfrew Center of Orlando<br><br> "An essential text. Webb provides guidance, wisdom, and inspiration. For courses on practice with children and families, this text is especially helpful as a step-by step guide to thoughtful, diversity-sensitive practice. It helps practitioners who are just starting out develop the capacity to work with challenging and complex populations. I found the text to be a wonderful companion to classroom discussions, with students expressing a significant connection to the realism and depth of the case studies."--Michael O. Weiner, LCSW, School of Social Work, Adelphi University<br><br>"Will clearly help in educating students at the undergraduate and graduate levels and preparing them for the challenges that they will face."

Evola selects specific examples from the Nordic, Vedic, Roman, Persian, Islamic and other traditions to demonstrate how traditionalists can prepare themselves to experience war in a way that will allow them to overcome the limited possibilities offered by our materialistic and degraded age, thereby transcending the Age of Kali and entering the world of heroism by achieving a higher state of consciousness, which Evola depicts as an effective realisation of the ultimate purpose of life.</p><p>His call to action, however, is not that of today&#x2019;s armies, which ask nothing more of their soldiers than to become mercenaries in the temporary employ of a decadent class. Still less is it a call to misdirected or nihilistic violence. Rather, Evola presents the warrior as one who lives an integrated and purposeful way of life &#x2013; one who adopts a specifically Aryan view of the world in which the political aims of a war are not its ultimate justification, but rather war is seen as merely a means through which the warrior finds his calling to a higher and more complete form of existence beyond the political, and in accordance with the teachings of the great spiritual texts. More importantly, he shows how the ideal of the warrior extends beyond the battlefield into other aspects of traditional living, even in times of peace.</p></p><p></p><h2>Chess For Kids</h2><p><p>This is the perfect introduction to chess for children from the age of seven upwards.

With Mother also still in a mental hospital at the time, my father, despite how disappointed he was in Haylee, was the only one who really could be involved in her present and future. Our grandparents and my father&#x2019;s brothers and their families were too far away to be of real assistance and still in quite a state of shock over what had happened to me and what Haylee had done.<br> <br>My father was overwhelmed himself by all that had occurred and had decided to take a leave of absence from his work for a few weeks after I was released from intensive psychiatric care following my rescue. He wanted to spend more time with me. Dr. Sacks had explained to him as well as to me that I had constantly to learn how to live with the memories of my horrible entrapment. He wanted to be there to help. Even though he needed the quiet time to handle all the legal and family issues, I knew he had put aside his professional life mostly to be there for me. In his mind, one of his daughters was probably lost forever. There was still a chance to save the other.<br> <br>My father had lived with Haylee alone, too, while I was still trapped in Anthony Cabot&#x2019;s basement apartment, because Mother was in a mental hospital. No one at the time, including him, knew what Haylee had done. My father admitted that the police detectives had some suspicions concerning Haylee, but he wouldn&#x2019;t let them pursue her because he couldn&#x2019;t imagine her doing what she had done. A central part of her plan was never to reveal to Anthony Cabot that she had a twin sister, so he was convinced that I was Haylee when I met him at that clandestine rendezvous my sister had arranged.<br> <br>Returning home felt so strange. Everything reminded me of Haylee and Mother, and it was weird at first not seeing either of them or hearing their voices and footsteps. Everything familiar had a different look to it. During those early hours at home, I anticipated Haylee popping out of a room or rushing up the stairs to tell me something &#x201c;we must never tell anyone else or hope to die!&#x201d;<br> <br>The silence was loud and in some ways was the most difficult thing to contend with, especially those first few nights, when I had to have my bedroom lights on and the door open. I don&#x2019;t think my father slept very much, either. He was probably lying there in his bed, poised to jump up and rush to my side because a nightmare had exploded behind my closed eyelids.<br> <br>Gradually, things improved, but almost as soon as my father brought me home, he and I immediately began to talk about my attending a private prep school, just as Dr. Sacks had intimated. From the things my father said, I realized he had obviously done a good deal of research on them.<br> <br>&#x201c;I agree with Dr. Sacks. I think you need a fresh start,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Make new friends. I found what I think is one of the best schools for you, Littlefield. It&#x2019;s about sixty miles northeast of here. It has a great academic reputation. I took a ride to see it. It&#x2019;s on a beautiful campus just outside the city of Carbondale, and what I like the most is that the class sizes are pretty small. You&#x2019;ll get a lot of personal attention.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Personal attention? More counseling?&#x201d; I grimaced. &#x201c;All my teachers will know and be expected to handle me in a special way?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, no, of course not. Nothing concerning what has happened will be anyone&#x2019;s business,&#x201d; he quickly said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll tell no one anything, not even the administration. You&#x2019;ll be just like any other student transferring in from a public school or a different private school.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What if someone looks me up on the Internet? There were newspaper stories.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why would anyone do that, Kaylee? Look,&#x201d; he added, leaning forward, &#x201c;you have to let it go, too. I know it&#x2019;s very difficult to do that, but if you don&#x2019;t, then, as Dr. Sacks says, you&#x2019;ll always be a victim. Right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t going to disagree about the school. I was still quite fragile, and talk about making so dramatic a new move frightened me. However, Dr. Sacks and I had spent a great deal of our time together talking about how I thought I was going to feel when and if I returned to my present school and my friends began asking me questions, hoping to get me to give them the disgusting details. I knew what concerned her as well as me. How could I not think everyone would look at me and think of me as a victim forever? Most would assume I had been raped repeatedly during my abduction. They would see my denial as some sort of mental defense, smile, nod, and tell me how happy they were that it hadn&#x2019;t happened, but surely they would whisper about it when I wasn&#x2019;t around. Their suspicions would haunt me. Their eyes would study my face, my hands, my arms, any part of me that was exposed, looking for scars.<br> <br>Actually, that sort of thing began as soon as people heard I had come home. Friends began to call, each one eager to be the first who had heard something, but I refused to speak to anyone. I knew what really lay beneath something as innocuous as &#x201c;How are you now?&#x201d; or &#x201c;Thank God you were rescued.&#x201d; They would all hope to trigger a flood of information from me, information they would take and spread like birdseed at the front door of every other classmate.<br> <br>My silence was unambiguous. I wouldn&#x2019;t tell anyone anything, no matter who it was. Some tried a few times and finally gave up. Soon no one called. I wouldn&#x2019;t accept any visitors, either, nor did I go anywhere on my own. My father was aware of how troubled I was about having to face down those inquisitive eyes. He tried to fill my time by taking me to restaurants out of our area and shopping in Philadelphia. At times, I thought he was in almost as deep a depression as Mother, who remained in the hospital. His emotions were inside a ping-pong ball bouncing from rage at Haylee and, of course, my abductor to sympathy for me, even sympathy for himself, and sometimes careening to compassionately consider Mother&#x2019;s condition, although I always had the sense that he countered her accusations against him by placing all the blame on her.<br> <br>For weeks after I came home, he and I tried to make sense of it all. We talked for hours sometimes after dinner, and when I was finally able to describe in detail some of the terrible things I had endured, his face would redden and his lips would drip his rage at Haylee. I didn&#x2019;t want to upset my father, but Dr. Sacks had urged me to do this, to confront the demons. &#x201c;The more you do, the faster you will defeat them,&#x201d; she said. Nevertheless, I knew it gave my father nightmares, as it still did to me.<br> <br>Ironically, however, the more he voiced his anger at Haylee, the sorrier I felt for her, which also made me sorrier for myself. I guess I couldn&#x2019;t help it. It was instinctive. We had lived this long protecting and sympathizing with each other. How could I stop doing it now, no matter what the circumstances? Mother was never angry at one of us without being angry at the other. That was still true.<br> <br>Haylee wasn&#x2019;t in a terrifying basement of terror like I had been, but just like me, she had a seemingly impossible challenge to overcome. How could she ever return to this world, her friends, and our school? The story was out; she was quite the villain, and I was quite the victim. Neither of us could face familiar faces. The irony was that we were still looking at the world in a similar way, and it was still looking at us the way it had. We were never able to throw off the oddity of being so similar in appearance. People called us the &#x201c;Mirror Sisters,&#x201d; no matter what we did, apparently.<br> <br>Would my visiting her now change any of it? Even when my father&#x2019;s anger simmered down to a low boil, he didn&#x2019;t push for me to visit Haylee and certainly never even suggested that I find a way to forgive her. In fact, he said, &#x201c;If you never wanted to see or talk to her again, I&#x2019;d understand. Who wouldn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br> <br>However, even though time has a way of frustrating vengeance, I&#x2019;d be a liar if I said I didn&#x2019;t want to see her where she was suffering for what she had done and enjoy her pain. During the early days after my rescue, when I was in the hospital, I found relief in raging about Haylee. Dr. Sacks thought that was healthy. &#x201c;Get it out. It&#x2019;s like steam. You need the release,&#x201d; she said. But even before that week ended, I was tempering the things I was saying about my sister, and if I did say something nasty, I always added, &#x201c;But I bet she&#x2019;s sorry now.&#x201d;<br> <br>I guess I was hoping that she was. Was I being stupid? I always looked quickly at Dr. Sacks to see if she would tell me any reason I should think Haylee was feeling sorry, but she either had no knowledge of Haylee&#x2019;s situation or didn&#x2019;t think it was wise to say. Whenever I asked my father about her, he would only say, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s being processed through the system.&#x201d; That made it sound as if she were some sort of product being manufactured. She was placed on the assembly line of rehabilitation. What about me? Could I ever really be rehabilitated? Haylee could finally realize her guilt and feel remorse, maybe, but how would I really recover? The nightmares might hibernate, but they&#x2019;d be back. I could go to another school, but could I make new friends? Would I ever trust anyone again? Friendships needed trust. Love especially needed it.<br> <br>As my rage subsided, though, my curiosity about Haylee increased. Just what sort of state of mind was she in now? Did she really regret anything? And if she did, did she regret it only because she had been caught? What had been her real intentions for me? Did she want me gone forever, or in the back of her mind had she been planning to rescue me herself and become a hero instead of a villain? How much was she really hurting now?<br> <br>Once, after I had come home from the hospital and after my father had visited Haylee for some legal reason, I asked him, &#x201c;Did she ask about me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t let her,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I made it clear to her from the start that I wouldn&#x2019;t believe she was asking sincerely about your condition, and I didn&#x2019;t volunteer any information. She&#x2019;s never going to work me again. I can assure you of that. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.&#x201d;<br> <br>His eyes were steely cold.<br> <br>I understood what he was saying, of course, but I also believed he had been away from us too long after the divorce to tell whether either of us was speaking sincerely. Haylee had burned him badly with her shrewd performance after Anthony Cabot had abducted me. My father described how she cried and went to my room to embrace my pillow and sob for hours. She broke everyone&#x2019;s heart by playing the piano while her face was streaked with tears, moaning that she could still hear me playing on mine and that it tore her heart. We had two pianos, and she and I would do duets. One of us never played without the other. Of course, she knew that. My father described how she had milked our friends of their sympathy and had taken advantage of everyone she could, getting classmates to do her homework for her and having them bring her gifts whenever they did visit. She was the &#x201c;suffering princess,&#x201d; while I was practically being waterboarded by a psychopath.<br> <br>My father listed the details like a prosecutor before a jury, a jury of one, me. If I mentioned something that reminded him of one of her conniving achievements, he went on and on from that example to another and then another.<br> <br>&#x201c;She had me up nights crying for her,&#x201d; he moaned, now feeling sorry for himself, too. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t work; I couldn&#x2019;t think. I did all sorts of things to get her not to worry about you and bought her all sorts of things, jewelry, dresses. I was even setting her up with her own car!&#x201d;<br> <br>He was still smarting from all that. He never stopped talking about it. It took little to set him off like a firecracker.<br> <br>I knew that he was thinking she had made a terrible fool of him in the community. His reputation and self-respect were seriously damaged. He had to face the police, his friends, and his fellow employees and somehow explain how his own daughter had pulled the wool over his eyes. The memory of every call he had made demanding more action and more attention after I had been abducted stung him now. He had the answer to the mystery living in the same house with him all the time and didn&#x2019;t know it. If Haylee hadn&#x2019;t gone too far with her wild behavior, he might never have gone to her computer and discovered what she had done. I was sure that realization also gave him additional nightmares.<br> <br>He insisted on keeping the door to her room shut now. He suggested that he might sell the second piano. He considered giving away all our duplicated toys from the past&#x2014;iPads, cell phones, even her jewelry and especially anything new he had gotten for her. Of course, Mother would never give away anything, even after all this. Everything, no matter how small, carried an important memory for her.<br> <br>&#x201c;You would sell the piano?&#x201d; I asked him when he rattled off his list.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why would we still need two? I can&#x2019;t imagine hearing another duet,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even imagine her back in this house! I want to get all her things out of here and nail the door to her room shut.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Daddy, stop!&#x201d; I cried. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re worrying me!&#x201d;<br> <br>He calmed. I really was concerned. He might give himself a heart attack, and then what would happen to me? I couldn&#x2019;t imagine living with my grandparents or my uncles and aunts. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine them wanting me. I was damaged goods.<br> <br>Of course, I understood his personal rage and why he blamed himself as well. On more than one occasion, he told me that a parent should know his own child well enough to realize when she is lying to him. I didn&#x2019;t come right out and say it, but I didn&#x2019;t think he should feel stupid for missing any clues. I just didn&#x2019;t know how to say it without making it look like Haylee had some special talent or gift, making it look like I still admired her for something.<br> <br>But the truth was that even if he hadn&#x2019;t been away from us as long as he was, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to tell whether Haylee was lying. Haylee and I were truly closer to each other than any two sisters could be. Mother had brought us up thinking and behaving as if we were halves of one person. If I was fooled, why should he be surprised that he was?<br> <br>Maybe Haylee did have a special talent for lying, although talent seems like the wrong word. That should be reserved for good things, but some people were gifted when it came to deception. They were born politicians, diplomats, and poker faces. Haylee was especially good at lying and looking innocent. Sometimes when we were very little, she was able to get me out of trouble when I accidentally had done something wrong or had forgotten something Mother wanted neither of us ever to forget.<br> <br>I had listened to Haylee twist the truth often. She did it so well that I almost believed her myself sometimes. Perhaps I was just as guilty of encouraging her because I appreciated the results she was able to achieve. I did admire her for how easily she could get people to believe what she wanted or question any criticism made of us, especially when we were permitted to attend public school at grade three after being homeschooled so long. She was always a...</p><h2>Shocking Secrets of Antiquity: Racial Wars of Bronze Age, Unusual Artifacts, Technolithic Engineering &amp; the Two Cataclysms that Buried History</h2><p>For thirty years now a cabal of popular authors like Graham Handcock, Robert Schoch, Robert Bauval, Andrew Collins, Brien Foerster and others have released a steady stream of books backed by major publishers that promote an entire inaccurate view of world history and human origins. This censorship grows as these authors borrow heavily from each others writings in the construction of their pseudo-history. In Shocking Secrets of Antiquity this censorship is broken, our incredible history laid bare. In this packed work citing over 247 sources we discover the mysteries of fossilized jellyfish, fate of the Cro-Magnon people, records and visitations of intruder planets, the capture of Luna and the Pre-Lunar World, the antediluvian memories of a Prior Creation, ancient accounts of the first appearance of Caucasians that shocked the preFlood races, the descent of the Anunna and their amazing technolithic engineering sciences, the Gihon Flood in the days of Enoch, Enoch&#39;s reign and identity as the Sumerian Enki, the Nephilim Dynasty, archaic Bronze Age race wars, the true chronology of the Great Pyramid of Giza and the facts that prove it to be the most unique monument on this planet. Breshears expounds like no other on the origin of the Goddess religions, the Seven Anunnaki Kings, the Old World calendars so misunderstood today, about the holographic nature of reality and the beings capable of entering and exiting this holography, that our world is an ancient prison, facts about the Great Deluge cataclysm that ended the entire global Early Bronze Age and the later Flood of Ogyges that collapsed the Middle Bronze Age world. He reveals the advanced secrets of the Zodiac, shows the history of the Phoenix Object, an ancient orbiting weapons platform specifically programmed to depopulate humanity at fixed times. Breshears has done his homework, cites his sources for all to see and NEVER cites an internet source. The Anunnaki Great Year of 600 year epochs is explained, amazing discoveries of gigantic human remains, the astonishing Serpent Code in the Bible, explains brilliantly on the mechanics of predictive systems of analysis and ends this incredible work with a breathtaking glimpse into the poison of religious programming and the hidden power within every human that is just waiting to be unleashed- Mickey Nicholson, Acquisitions Consultant, www.nephilimarchives.com</p><p></p><h2>For the Love of Books: Designing and Curating a Home Library</h2><p><p><i>A celebration of the meaning and comfort printed books bring to our homes and lives, from the curation and design experts at Juniper Books.</i></p> <p>Explore the significance of the home library, embellished with alluring photography and illustrations, in a keepsake worthy of any bibliophile&#x2019;s collection. <i>For the Love of Books</i> shares the vision of Juniper Books, a business that embraces the roles that books fulfill in our lives and their staying power.

The same principle applies to man, otherwise he too will sink back into the soft ground and become swallowed up by the world of illusion."<br><br>--Sai Baba<br><br>If you ask any mom-to-be her greatest wish for her children, the first thing she'll say is, "I want them to be healthy!" Of course, some circumstances surrounding the health of our children are beyond our control. But there are many things you can absolutely do to make sure your children are healthy from the moment you find out they're coming into the world. During pregnancy, your baby is as much a part of you as your internal organs. By eating healthy foods, exercising, and destressing, not only will you feel better physically and emotionally, you'll also create a solid, healthy foundation for both you and your baby.<br><br>Women who adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles throughout pregnancy generally have fewer risks and complications, straightforward births, and an easier time bouncing back postdelivery than those who don't. When I say "healthy lifestyle," I'm talking about balancing the food and supplements you consume, exercising, and managing stress. And this lifestyle doesn't have to end once you give birth--by shifting your habits, you'll feel better for life.<br><br>It's never too late--or too early--to establish a healthy routine. During the first month of pregnancy, you may not even realize that you're pregnant, so it makes sense to take stock of your prepregnancy lifestyle. Note the foods you've been eating, whether you're mostly active or sedentary, and how stressed-out you feel on a daily basis. Evaluating your lifestyle now will help you to create a healthy environment for yourself and your children in the future. The better care you take of yourself during pregnancy, the better care you'll be taking of the baby within you. Your baby is dependent on you to make choices that best support her growth and development. Changing less-than-ideal eating and lifestyle habits during the first month of your pregnancy lays the foundation for the months (and years!) to come. This chapter explores why mind/body health matters for you and your baby.<br><br>"The greatest wealth is health."<br><br>--Virgil<br><br>YOUR CHANGING BODY<br><br>Are you really pregnant for 10 months instead of 9? If you've just found out that you're pregnant, your doctor probably did the math to arrive at a due date 40 weeks away. Caregivers calculate your due date from the beginning of your last menstrual cycle, since it's difficult to pin down the actual date of conception. So for calculation purposes, you're "pregnant" before you even conceive.<br><br>The first month of pregnancy is an exciting yet fragile time, one with a lot of questions, concerns, and the beginning of many strange physical and emotional feelings. You may not feel overly sick or tired just yet, but that doesn't mean there aren't major developments going on! Many women experience subtle symptoms of pregnancy in the beginning, while others don't even notice. Early symptoms include:<br><br>� Missed period<br>�&nbsp;Tender breasts and nipples<br>�&nbsp;Aversions to certain foods or smells<br>�&nbsp;Mood swings<br>�&nbsp;Cravings for certain foods<br>�&nbsp;Tiredness and general fatigue<br><br>At this point, there's more happening in your uterus than anywhere else in your body. You may not be feeling any pregnancy "symptoms" by Week Four, but there are lots of ways to connect with yourself and your rapidly growing baby-to-be.<br><br>"CALLING IN" YOUR BABY<br><br>"The deeper the roots, the higher the branches."<br><br>--Unknown<br><br>Sit in a comfortable position in a quiet space where you won't be disturbed. Place your hands on your lower belly and begin to breathe in through your nose, feeling your breath in your belly. Do this for 4 slow counts. Exhale for 4 slow counts as you allow your whole belly and body to relax and soften. Do this deep-breathing cycle three times.<br><br>Next, imagine a baby--your baby--and slowly begin to deep-breathe again. Breathe in while picturing this baby, again breathing through your nose and into your belly. While you are breathing, visualize becoming pregnant with this child. As you exhale, relax and soften your body, allowing your body to receive this baby. Again, repeat three times.<br><br>Begin to see yourself with your baby. Imagine the child and what it would be like for you and your partner to be together with this baby. Envision and, more importantly, feel your life with this child. Notice how you feel being her mother, having her in your arms, close to you. Name that feeling (joy, love, bliss, etc.), breathe that feeling into your heart, and exhale anything out that might be blocking you (for example, stress, doubt, or fear). Allow this positive feeling to flood over you as you let go of disappointment, sadness, or worries.<br><br>See your baby in your arms and from this loving place in your heart talk to her, telepathically or out loud. Tell her (as you feel this energy) how much you can't wait to be her mother; show her what her life with you will be like, let her know you are ready for her to "Come home to me now," that you are open and ready to receive her and can't wait to hold her in your arms. Show her all you have been doing to prepare and ask if she needs anything from you. You might hear something or you might not. Keep talking as long as you need to, and end with "Come home to me now. I am open and fully ready to receive you into my heart and into my life."<br><br>Next, cut out inspirational pictures of couples, families, and babies and glue them onto a tall, glass-encased white candle or large piece of paper. Add pictures of yourself, your partner, dog, parents, or perhaps places you love. Place objects that are meaningful to you around the candle or sheet of paper (crystals, goddess statues, baby clothes) like you are making a baby altar.<br><br>Place a few drops of scented oil into the top of the candle and light it. Let the candle burn all the way down.<br><br>After you do the visualization from the calling-in ritual (above), write a heartfelt letter to your baby. It's never too early to start communicating with your baby, even through words on paper. I also suggest starting a baby book, journal, or scrapbook--something to collect your keepsakes, photos, and memories of meaningful moments of your pregnancy and birth. Start the book with this special letter. This will be something to share with your child as he grows to show how much he was loved before he was born.<br><br>Writing a letter to your baby-to-be can be the first connection you make with the tiny person inside you. It doesn't have to be a long letter, just something from your heart that speaks to you and your child about the journey you're both about to embark on. Engage your partner, too, and you'll both have a chance to express your thoughts to your new addition.<br><br>WHAT TO EAT FOR THE FIRST MONTH<br><br>"Don't eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn't recognize as food."<br><br>--Michael Pollan<br><br>Food is a major focus during pregnancy. It serves as the basis for your baby's growth and survival. Eating a well-rounded, balanced diet full of organic, hormone-free, genetically modified organism (GMO)-free whole foods is ideal, especially during pregnancy. Each month, as your body and baby grow together, I'm going to highlight specific food groups and types of food to focus on. This doesn't mean you should stop eating other healthy food groups you've already incorporated into your diet. The growing list of foods I will provide offers a wide variety of healthy and tasty options for you during your entire pregnancy.<br><br>Did you know that what a woman consumes while pregnant shapes her child's palate later on? Studies from the Monell Chemical Senses Center have shown the food that mom eats flavors the amniotic fluid, which in turn is swallowed by the fetus. Babies are actually "tasting" foods! You have the opportunity to teach your baby to love healthy foods before he's even born (which is a lot easier than teaching a toddler).<br><br>There is a common misconception that "eating for two" during pregnancy means you need to consume a lot more food. Not true! While pregnant, you need to consume only 250 more calories per day than before pregnancy. Chances are, if you're eating a typical American diet, you're getting way more than the daily calories you need, even with a growing baby. Instead of worrying about eating enough food, focus more on the food's quality. The healthier you eat, the better you will feel and the stronger your body will be to support your pregnancy and labor. You can shift your awareness simply by asking yourself these two questions: How is this food feeding me? How is it fueling my baby's development?<br><br>EATING HEALTHY ON A BUDGET<br><br>Eating healthy does not have to mean breaking the bank! Follow these tips for balanced nutrition on a budget.<br><br>�&nbsp;Grow your own garden. Even if you can only grow herbs like basil, oregano, and parsley or a few vegetables, you'll save money on seasonings (and your food will taste better than anything packaged).<br><br>�&nbsp;Buy foods like beans, grains, nuts, and pastas in bulk. They're less expensive when you buy more at once, and they keep well in a dry pantry for a long time.<br><br>�&nbsp;Prioritize what's most important to buy organic. Look at the Environmental Working Group (EWG) Web site, which lists the "Dirty Dozen," the fruits and veggies that absorb the most pesticides and so should be eaten organic.<br><br>�&nbsp;Shop at local farmers' markets and buy produce that is in season. These foods tend to be less expensive because they are at their peak of production.<br><br>�&nbsp;Buy generics. Stores such as Whole Foods and Trader Joe's have their own brands, which are generally less expensive and taste just as good. Many other grocery stores have their own organic brands, too.<br><br>�&nbsp;Eat out less. Browse the cookbook shelf to find recipes that excite you. Turn on some music, set a pretty table, and enjoy the process of cooking and dining at home.<br><br>�&nbsp;Plan out your meals for the week ahead before you go food shopping. Make a list and buy only what you plan to prepare for the week. This will cut down on fresh food that spoils before you can use it and impulse buys that you really don't need.<br><br>Here are my top tips for building a healthy nutritional foundation for you and your baby.<br><br>Eat as Organic as You Can<br><br>Organic foods are certified to be free of any chemical treatments. Pregnant women and children are the most vulnerable to these toxins. The Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), updated in 2014, measured pesticides and other chemicals in the bodies of Americans every few years. Results of the study consistently show that pesticides cross the placenta and can be absorbed by the fetus during pregnancy.<br><br>Growth hormones are found in cattle, poultry, and eggs that don't come from organic farms. Growth hormones have been linked to certain cancers and can alter hormone production, which, according to a study from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital, can lead to early puberty in girls and cause development and reproductive problems. Organic foods might cost a little more, but can you really put a price on your family's health?<br><br>Eat for Fuel<br><br>Whole foods (nonprocessed, fresh, high-quality, nutrient-rich foods) are filled with a ton of healing properties. Take bananas, for example. These sweet, simple fruits are both high in potassium and rich in iron, which can help your nerves and muscles function properly as well as help carry oxygen throughout your blood. Their serotonin boosts mood, fiber helps battle constipation, and alkaline properties help neutralize stomach acidity from heartburn or ulcers.<br><br>When we see how food really feeds us, both physically and emotionally, our relationship with food and eating will change. Food truly is fuel to get your body to move, grow, feel, and heal. My intention in teaching you about the healing properties of foods is that when you eat, you'll connect with how this food is doing something not only for your body, but for your baby, as well. After working with me, lots of my clients develop a new relationship with food. I see them eat completely differently than they used to and even feed their children with the intention of doing something positive for their lives.<br><br>Increase Your Intake of Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements<br><br>A good prenatal vitamin helps to ensure that you and your growing baby are getting a balanced amount of vitamins and minerals each day. It's best to start taking one a few months before trying to get pregnant, but don't worry if you didn't. However, as soon as you find out you're pregnant, finding a prenatal vitamin is essential. I prefer food-based (nonsynthetic) vitamins, as they're the most natural form and are easier to digest. One prenatal vitamin a day, however, won't give you the extra boost of many vitamins and minerals that will help prep your body and baby for growth. Here are some vitamins and supplements I think are essential to take during pregnancy.<br><br>Vitamin D (up to 4,000 IU a day): Most prenatal vitamins contain around 400 IU of vitamin D. A study from Diabetologia (the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes) explains that increasing your vitamin D intake up to 4,000 IU a day can reduce your risk of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure), and premature birth.<br><br>Did you know that vitamin D is known as the "sunshine vitamin"? The body produces it naturally when exposed to sunlight. Believe it or not, an easy way to get extra vitamin D while pregnant is to go outside around noon and sit in the sun with your belly exposed for 10 to 20 minutes. I also like vitamin D drops, especially for those who hate swallowing pills. Place a few drops on your tongue, and you're done for the day.<br><br>Vitamin E (400 to 600 IU a day): In the book For the Childbearing Year, Susun Weed, an herbalist and director of the Wise Woman Center in Woodstock, New York, explains that taking vitamin E throughout the first trimester helps the embryo adhere to the wall of your uterus and has been shown to help prevent miscarriage. Stop taking vitamin E after the third month to prevent abnormal adhering.<br><br>Probiotics: These healthful, "good" bacteria live in your colon. When "bad" bacteria form in your gut, causing diarrhea or a yeast infection, probiotics replenish the good bacteria and help restore your belly's balance. The most popular probiotic is Lactobacillus acidophilus, found in yogurt and other cultured foods. (Look for the phrase "live and active cultures" on the label.) Probiotics can be found in pill or powder form or in dairy products such as kefir or yogurt, which can be added to smoothies or cereal if you don't like to eat dairy alone.</p><h2>The Disney Collection (Piano - Vocal - Guitar Series)</h2><p>(Piano/Vocal/Guitar Songbook).

Based on the latest historical research, <i>Voices of Ancient Egypt</i> conveys a dramatic sense of everyday life in this multicultural civilization.</p><p>Kay Winters was captivated by Egypt during visits as a language arts consultant in the American International Schools in Cairo and Alexandria. This author of numerous children&#x2019;s books now lives in Quakertown, PA.<br><br>Barry Moser is an award-winning artist, illustrator, book designer and publisher. His work graces the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum collections.Grade 4-6-This book presents the voices of 13 individuals in various Old Kingdom occupations, ranging from scribe to herdsman. Winters uses first-person, free-verse poems to describe the workers' duties and places in society. Her verse is rich with informative detail: "I am a washer of clothes./Brother to the crocodile,/I spend my days in water./I soak the clothes, beat them with a wooden stave,/then wrap them around a stick/to wring out the wet." The author gives voice to the birdnetter and marshman, whom other authors neglect or lump together under headings such as "Peasants." Women are represented in the occupations of farmer, dancer, and weaver. Moser provides visual context for the selections with delicately textured watercolors. Clothing, tools, and landscapes are imagined with such faithful attention to historical detail that readers will learn as much from the illustrations as from the text. The figures, rendered in warm brown hues, embody the grace and serene strength often associated with ancient Egyptian culture. Together, text and art lend dignity to each laborer's efforts, working from the assumption that stonecutters and sailors alike took pride in their contributions to Pharaoh's kingdom.

She has written a number of successful math concept books, including: <em>Pattern Bugs</em>, <em>20 Hungry Piggies</em>, <em>Jenny Found a Penny</em>, <em>The Clock Struck One</em>, and <em>Tally Cat Keeps Track</em>. Trudy loves reading picture books to her grandchildren and to her students at Temple View Elementary in Idaho Falls, Idaho.</p>PreSchool-Grade 1-Although there's not much of a story line in this appealing concept book, there is definitely more here than initially meets the eye. The rhyming prose and brightly colored cartoon fish inhabit a world of patterns, beginning with the simplest AB pattern and growing increasingly complex. Upon closer inspection, the patterns can be seen echoing throughout, as pictures both express and reinforce the pattern of the words. For example, the ABB pattern introduced by an eel is echoed not only on the creature's body (stripe-dot-dot), but also in the bubbles that issue from its mouth (large-small-small), the underwater reeds (short-tall-tall) and plants (curve-star-star), and borders of the page (yellow-red-red). Once children get the idea, they will enjoy discovering the repetition and looking for examples. A clear and effective teaching tool.<br><i>Robin L.

After the summer heat, before the winter bleakness, before snow and rain are even dreamed of. A time that stands out crystal clear, as the air begins to cool; a time when the skies are still bright blue, when it feels good to wear wool again, and one walks faster than one has in months. A time to come alive again, to plan, to act, to be, as September marches into October. It is a time when women look better, men feel better, even the children look crisp again as they return to school in Paris or New York or San Francisco. And maybe even more so in Rome. Everyone is home again after the lazy months of summer spent clattering along in ancient taxis from the piazza to the Marina Piccola in Capri, or they are fresh from the baths in Ischia, the sun-swept days at San Remo, or even simply the public beach in Ostia. But in late September it is over, and autumn has arrived. A businesslike month, a beautiful month, when it feels good just to be alive.<br><br> Isabella di San Gregorio sat sedately in the backseat of the limousine. She was smiling to herself, her dark eyes dancing, her shining black hair held away from her face by two heavy tortoise shell combs as she watched passersby walking quickly through the streets. Traffic was as Roman traffic always is: terrifying. She was used to it, she had lived there all her life, except for her occasional visits to her mother's family in Paris and the one year she had spent in the States at twenty-one. The following year she had married Amadeo and become a legend of sorts, the reigning queen of Roman couture. She was by birth a princess in that realm, and by marriage something more, but her legend had been won by her talent, not only by acquiring Amadeo's name. Amadeo di San Gregorio had been the heir to the House of San Gregorio, the tabernacle of Roman couture, the pinnacle of prestige and exquisite taste in the eternal international competition between women of enormous means and aspirations. San Gregorio--sacred words to sacred women, and Isabella and Amadeo the most sacred words of all. He in all his golden, green-eyed Florentine magnificence, inheriting the house at thirty-one; she the granddaughter of Jacques Louis-Parel, the king of Paris couture since 1910.<br><br> Isabella's father had been Italian but had always taken pleasure in telling her he was quite sure that her blood was entirely French. She had French feelings and French ideas, French style, and her grandfather's unerring taste. At seventeen she had known more about high fashion than most men in the business at forty-five. It was in her veins, her heart, her spirit. She had an uncanny gift for design, a brilliance with color, and a knowledge of what worked and what didn't that came from studying her grandfather's collections year after year. When at last in his eighties he had sold Parel to an American corporation, Isabella had sworn that she would never forgive him.<br><br> She had, of course. Still if he had only waited, if he had known, if...but then she would have had a life in Paris and never met Amadeo as she had when she set up her own tiny design studio in Rome at twenty-two. It had taken six months for their paths to cross, six weeks for their hearts to determine what the future would be, and only three months after that before Isabella became Amadeo's wife and the brightest light in the heavens of the House of San Gregorio. Within a year she became his chief designer, a seat for which any designer would have died.<br><br> It was easy to envy Isabella. She had it all: elegance, beauty, a crown of success that she wore with the casual ease of a Borsalino hat, and the kind of style that would still make an entire room stop to stare at her in her ninetieth year. Isabella di San Gregorio was every inch a queen, and yet there was more. The quick laughter; the sudden flash of diamonds set in the rich onyx eyes; her way of understanding what was behind what people said, who they were, why they were, what they were and weren't and dreamed of being. Isabella was a magical woman in a marvelous world.<br><br> The limousine slowed in a last traffic snarl at the edge of the Piazza Navona, and Isabella sat back dreamily and closed her eyes. The blast of horns and invective was dimmed by the tightly sealed windows of the car, and her ears were too long accustomed to the sounds of Rome to be disturbed by the noise. She enjoyed it, she thrived on it. It was a part of the very fiber of her being, just as the mad pace of her business was part of her. It would be impossible to live without either one. Which was why she would never leave her business life entirely, despite her semiretirement of the year before. When Alessandro had been born five years before, the business had been everything to her, the spring line, the threat of espionage from a rival house, the importance of developing a boutique line of ready-to-wear to export to the States, the wisdom of adding men's wear and eventually cosmetics and perfume and soap. All of it mattered to her intensely. She couldn't give it up, not even for Amadeo's child. This was her lifeblood, her dream. But as the years had gone by, she had felt an ever greater gnawing at her soul, a yearning, a loneliness when she returned home at eight thirty and the child was already asleep, tucked into bed by other hands than hers.<br><br> "It bothers you, doesn't it?" Amadeo had watched her as she sat pensively in the long gray satin chair set just so in the corner of the sitting room.<br><br> "What?" She had seemed distracted as she answered, tired, disturbed.<br><br> "Isabellezza--" Isa-beauty. It always made her smile when he called her that. He had called her that from the first. "Talk to me."<br><br> She had smiled at him sheepishly and let out a long sigh. "I am."<br><br> "I was asking you if it bothers you very much not being here with the child."<br><br> "Sometimes. I don't know. It's hard to explain. We have--we have lovely times together. On Sundays, when I have time." A tiny tear had crept out of one of the brilliantly dark eyes, and Amadeo held out his arms to her. She had gone to them willingly and smiled through her tears. "I'm crazy. I have everything. I...why doesn't the damn nurse keep him up 'til we come home?"<br><br> "<i>Alle dieci?</i>" At ten o'clock?<br><br> "It isn't, it's only...." She had looked at her watch in irritation and then realized that he was right. They had left the office at eight, stopped to see their lawyer at his home for an hour, stopped for yet another "minute" to kiss their favorite American client in her suite at the Hassler, and...ten o'clock. "Damn. All right, so it's late. But usually we're home at eight, and he's never awake." She had glared at Amadeo, and he had laughed gently as he held her in his arms.<br><br> "What do you want?" One of those children that movie stars take to cocktail parties when they're nine? Why don't you take off more time?"<br><br> "I can't."<br><br> "You don't want to."<br><br> "Yes I do...no, I don't." They had both laughed. It was true. She did and she didn't. She wanted to be with Alessandro, before she missed it all, before he was suddenly nineteen and she had missed her chance. She had seen it happen to too many women with careers--they mean to, they're going to, they want to, and they never do. They wake up one morning and their children are gone. The trips to the zoo that never happened, the movies, the museums, the moments they meant to share, but the phones were ringing, the clients waiting. The great events. She didn't want that to happen to her. It hadn't mattered so much when he was a baby. But now it was different. He was four and he knew when he didn't see her for more than two hours in three days, he knew when she was never there to pick him up at school, or when she and Amadeo spent six insane weeks planning the next collection or the line for the States.<br><br> "You look miserable, my love. You want me to fire you?" To Amadeo's astonishment as well as her own she had nodded. "Are you serious?" Shock registered in his eyes.<br><br> "Partly. There must be a way for me to work part of the time and be here a little bit more too." She had looked around the splendor of their villa, thinking of the child she hadn't seen all day.<br><br> "Let's think about it, Bellezza. We'll work something out."<br><br> And they had. It was perfect. For the past eight months she had been chief design consultant to the House of San Gregorio. She made all the same decisions she had always made, she had her hand in every pie. The unmistakable hand of Isabella was still recognizable in every design San Gregorio sold. But she had removed herself from the mechanics of the business, from the nitty-gritty of the everyday. It meant overburdening still further their beloved director, Bernardo Franco, and it meant hiring another designer to carry out the interminable steps between Isabella's concepts and the final product. But it was working perfectly. Now Isabella came and went. She sat in on major meetings. She pored over everything with Amadeo during one marathon day each week. She stopped in unexpectedly whenever she had an appointment nearby, but for the first time she felt she was truly Alessandro's mother now too. They had lunch in the garden. She saw him in his first school play. She took him to the park and taught him nursery rhymes in English and funny little songs in French. She laughed with him, ran with him, and pushed him on the swing. She had the best of all possible worlds. A business, a husband, and a child. And she had never been happier in her life. It showed in the light that danced in her eyes, in the way she moved and laughed and looked when Amadeo came home. It showed in the things she said to her friends as she regaled them with tales of Alessandro's latest accomplishments: "And my God, how that child can draw!" Everyone was amused. Most of all Amadeo, who wanted her to be happy. After ten years of marriage he still adored her. In fact, more than he ever had. And the business was thriving, despite the slight change of regime. Isabella could never absent herself totally. It simply wasn't her style. Her presence was felt everywhere. The sound of her echoed like a perfectly formed crystal bell.<br><br> The limousine stopped at the curb as Isabella caught a last glimpse of people on the street. She liked what women were wearing this year. Sexy, more feminine. Reminiscent of her grandfather's collections in years before. It was a look that pleased her very much. She herself stepped from the car in an ivory wool dress, perfectly draped into a river of tiny, impeccably executed pleats. Her three long strands of enormous pearls hung from her neck at precisely the right depth of the softly draped neckline, and over her arm was a short chocolate mink jacket, a fur that had been designed just for her in Paris by the furrier once employed by Parel. But she was in too much of a hurry to slip it on. She wanted to discuss some last-minute details of the American line with Amadeo, before meeting a friend for lunch. She glanced at the faceless gold watch on her wrist as a sapphire and a diamond floated mysteriously on its face, indicating only to the initiated the exact time. It was ten twenty-two.<br><br> "Thank you, Enzo. I'll be out five minutes before noon." Holding the door with one hand, he touched his cap with the other and smiled. She was easy to work for these days, and he enjoyed the frequent trips in the car with the little boy. It reminded him of his own grandchildren, seven of whom lived in Bologna, the other five in Venice. He visited them sometimes. But Rome was his home. Just as it was Isabella's, despite her French mother and her year in the States. Rome was a part of her, she was born there, she had to live there, she would die there. He knew what every Italian knew, that a Roman was meant to live nowhere else.<br><br> As she walked decisively across the sidewalk toward the heavy black door in the ancient facade, she glanced up the street as she always did. It was a sure way to know if Amadeo was in. All she had to do was look for the long silver Ferrari, parked at the curb. The silver torpedo, she called it. And no hands touched that car, except his. Everyone teased him about it, especially Isabella. He was like a small child with a toy. He didn't want to share it. He drove it, he parked it, pampered it, and played with it. All by himself. Not even the doorman at San Gregorio, who had worked there for forty-two years, had ever touched that car. Isabella was smiling to herself as she approached the impressive black door. At times he was like a little boy; it only made her love him more.<br><br> <i>"Buon giorno, Signora Isabella."</i> Only Ciano, the grandfatherly doorman in black-and gray livery, called her that.<br><br> <i>"Ciao, Ciano, come sta?"</i> Isabella smiled widely at him, displaying teeth as beautiful as her much celebrated pearls. <i>"Va b?ne?"</i> It goes well?<br><br> <i>"Benissimo."</i> The rich baritone rolled musically at her as he swept the heavy door open with a bow.<br><br> The door shut resoundingly behind her as she stood in the entrance hall for a moment, looking around. As much as the villa on the Via Appia Antica, this was her home. The perfect pink marble floor, the gray velvets and rose silks, the crystal chandelier that she had brought from Parel in Paris after long negotiation with its American owner. Her grandfather had had it made in Vienna, and it was almost beyond price. A sweeping marble staircase rose to the main salon above. On the third and fourth floors were offices done in the same grays and pinks, the colors of rose petals and ashes. It was a combination that pleased the eye as much as the carefully selected paintings, the antique mirrors, the elegant light fixtures, the little Louis XVI love seats tucked into alcoves here and there where clients could rest and chat. Maids in gray uniforms scurried everywhere, their starched white aprons making crisp little noises as they brought tea and sandwiches to the private rooms upstairs where clients stood through arduous fittings, wondering how the models survived entire shows. Isabella stood for a moment, as she often did, surveying her domain.<br><br> She slipped quietly into the private elevator, pressing the button for the fourth floor, as she began to go over the morning's work in her head. There were just a few things to take care of; she had settled most of the current business yesterday, to her satisfaction. There had been design details to work out with Gabriela, the chief designer, and administrative problems to discuss with Bernardo and Amadeo. Today's work wouldn't take her long at all. The door slid silently open and revealed the long gray carpeted hall. Everything about the House of San Gregorio was downplayed. Unlike Isabella, who was anything but. She was obvious and splendid and eminently visible. She was a woman one saw and wanted to see, a woman one wanted to be seen by. But the House of San Gregorio was a showcase for beauty. It was important that what they had to show there was not overwhelmed by the house itself.</p><h2>What Happened in the Garden?: The Reality and Ramifications of the Creation and Fall of Man</h2><p>Evangelicals are no strangers to the creation versus evolution debate. Now the argument has spread beyond the contents of the creation account and into Genesis 2-3, with speculation about the historicity of Adam, and the fall. But does it matter which position one holds? Is anything really at stake? <p> The faculty of The Master's College come together to contend that the second and third chapters of Genesis are indeed historical, that there are excellent reasons for believing so, and that it is an essential issue within Christian thought and life. The contents of these chapters establish the history of how everything in the world came to be what it is today. This Scripture passage&#x2014;Genesis 3 especially&#x2014;explains what we observe in the legal system, literature, gender roles, education, psychology, and science. Far from irrelevant, the theology and historicity of Genesis are in fact critical to our everyday lives.</p> <p><i>What Happened in the Garden?</i> includes new scientific, literary, business, educational, and legal perspectives on creation. Through this multidisciplinary look at the debate, the contributors prove that to change our understanding of the fall is to change the way we understand reality, to revise the Christian worldview, and to reshape the faith itself.</p></p><p>Abner Chou is professor of biblical studies at The Master&#x2019;s College and Seminary.

She is best known for her collection of Norwegian knitting patterns, which in 1929 led to the publication of the book Norwegian knitting patterns . She worked at the Norwegian Folk Museum when she started collecting the patterns, and her collection of knitting patterns laid the foundation for the diversity of knitting patterns that is known in Norway today.ANNICHEN SIBBERN B�HN carried out the large project of collecting patterns from all around Norway in the 1920&#x2019;s. The result was her book, Norske strikkem�nstre, first published in 1929 and translated to English as Norwegian Knitting Designs (1965). It has been a source of inspiration ever since then. Numerous garments have been knitted from the motifs in the book and have warmed big and small for generations. What a lovely thought.<br> I don&#x2019;t remember when I first became aware of the book, but, after that, I often popped into used book shops I happened to pass by, hoping to find a copy. I was so happy when I finally did. The copies I have are both stained and loosened from their bindings, but that hasn&#x2019;t diminished my happiness at finally becoming the owner of this treasure of a book.<br> And suddenly, one day, I was given the opportunity to become part of this book project, a project that will clearly blow new life into Annichen Sibbern B�hn&#x2019;s old book. It was almost too good to be true and I consider myself very honored! The work of producing this book is one of the most exciting projects I&#x2019;ve done as a designer. My challenge and my goal was to inspire a wider use of Annichen&#x2019;s old classic. Some of the patterns here, with a few small changes, are almost the same as the originals in the old book. Others are new designs. They are examples of how and for what one can use the motifs. In the hope that &#x201c;everyone&#x201d; will find something tempting, I have arranged a varied selection of patterns based on different yarn qualities and knitting gauges. Several of the models are also shown in different color combinations to illustrate how color choice can influence the look. This just shows some of the possibilities opened for us by Annichen with her fine, little book. Remember, it is only your imagination that sets boundaries. Use the charts for all they are worth: combine different panels, motifs, and cable patterns. Turn them upside-down, sideways, or mirror-image. Pick out small or large elements from the same chart or different charts, and re-arrange them for new motifs. Use sock patterns as ideas for mittens or use mitten motifs as ideas for socks. Take a pattern panel from a sweater-jacket design and knit it on a cap. Use the thumb chart for adult mittens to adapt for baby mittens or egg cozies. Knit a baby coverlet using the pattern for the body of a jacket. Enlarge or reduce the patterns by using different yarn types and needle sizes. Changing, adjusting, and developing old patterns is absolutely allowed and sometimes even necessary. It is how our knitting tradition is managed and developed.<br> Earlier in time, knitting patterns often had very sparse in instructions that could also be quite inaccurate. Knitting was important and many people, both women and men, were very accomplished at it. Not everyone was quite so expert but they knitted as best they could anyway. Mostly, their work was very good, if perhaps not always totally perfect, but does it have to be? If you look through old photo archives, at museum collections, and in drawers and cupboards, you&#x2019;ll soon recognize that there were many variations that started with the same motifs or instructions. They could have been the result of, among other aspects, very abbreviated instructions or perhaps no pattern at all, varying degrees of experience and access to materials, and, not least, creativity. Although people often had to knit to have a few warm garments, I choose to believe that creativity and the pleasure of creating was also a strong motivator.<br> I am both humbled and proud about having been given the opportunity for writing this book. I hope it brings happiness, inspiration, and enjoyment to many. Together we can propel our wonderful knitting heritage and handcraft traditions into the future &#x2013; a privilege that is important, right, and uplifting &#x2013; it warms a knitter&#x2019;s heart.<br> Best wishes for knitting pleasure.<br><br>Wenche Roald</p><h2>My First Classical Music Book: Book &amp; CD (Naxos My First... Series)</h2><p>My First Classical Music Book is a delightfully colorful introduction to classical music, designed to fire the imagination of children aged 5-7 years. Readers are asked to think about the different places in which we might hear music. Then, each of the major composers and musical instrument families are introduced and brought to life in a vivid and enchanting way. Throughout the book, children are referred to the accompanying audio CD so that they can hear examples as they read. This is the most exceptional book of its kind, providing an absorbing experience for both eyes and ears.</p><p>An exuberant and fascinating introduction to instruments, melodies and composers alike - Handel, Brahms, Stravinsky, John Adams are all included - and comes with a CD, the carefully chosen tracks dovetailing nicely with the text. - Judith Woods, The Daily Telegraph &#39;For younger listeners, My First Classical Music Book by Genevieve Helsby combines a picture book and a 69-minute CD in a venture that gives the project of introducing children to proper music its biggest boost since Peter and the Woolf. Dotted among Jason Chapman&#39;s lively illustrations are some facts even grown-ups won&#39;t know...and there is even a game attempt to evoke the special quality of minimalist music: &#39;Listening to it is like staring at a fire, or at the sea; you find yourself stuck there, just watching, listening...&#39;. Helsby does an excellent job of making classical msuic accessible and entertaining, with well-chosen CD tracks that kick off with the theme music from the Harry Potter films (by Carl Davis) and follow up with a rousing greatest-hits selection from Offenbach&#39;s Can-Can to Saint-Saens&#39;s animals, and just a small sample of the dread minimalism thrown in. A sticker on the cover recommends it for ages five to seven, though it would entertain anyone with a few gaps in their knowledge to plug and a few hours of summer leisure time to while away.&#39; - Karen Robinson, The Sunday Times</p><h2>The Devil Is a Part-Timer, Vol. 1 - manga (The Devil Is a Part-Timer!

Most of Israel&#39;s pastoral imagery is grounded in two traditions: Moses as God&#39;s under-shepherd and David as shepherd-king. These traditions, explains author Timothy S. Laniak, provided prototypes for leaders that followed, and formed the background for the ministry of Jesus, the good shepherd. The pastoral role was central to the ongoing life of local churches in the Christian movement, and today&#39;s pastors are still called to be shepherds after God&#39;s own heart, to lead his people, living on the margins of settled society, to their eternal home. In this New Studies in Biblical Theology volume, Laniak draws on a wide range of Old and New Testament texts to develop the biblical theology of &#34;shepherd&#34; imagery, and concludes with some principles and implications for contemporary pastoral ministry. A wonderful resource for pastors, teachers and seminary students, as well as readers interested in the study of biblical imagery. Addressing key issues in biblical theology, the works comprising New Studies in Biblical Theology are creative attempts to help Christians better understand their Bibles. The NSBT series is edited by D. A. Carson, aiming to simultaneously instruct and to edify, to interact with current scholarship and to point the way ahead.</p><p>Features &amp; Benefits <p>* Offers insight into the biblical understanding of the metaphor of the shepherd/pastor</p><p>* Presents an antidote to unbiblical notions of this metaphor and its pastoral implications</p><p>* Highlights the key elements involved in the development of this metaphor in the Bible</p><p>* Features a wealth of interaction with ancient Near Eastern culture and history</p><p>* Provides a definitive resource for exploration of this important issue</p><p>* Serves pastors and lay leaders who desire assistance in understanding this topic</p>Timothy Laniak is associate professor of Old Testament and coordinator of the Urban Ministry Certificate Program at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, Charlotte, North Carolina.

In this book Thomas Talbott seeks to expose the extent to which the Western theological tradition has managed to twist the New Testament message of love, forgiveness, and hope into a message of fear and guilt. According to the New Testament proclamation, he argues, God&#39;s love is both unconditional in its nature and unlimited in its scope; hence, no one need fear, for example, that God&#39;s love might suddenly turn into loveless hatred at the moment of one&#39;s physical death. For God&#39;s love remains the same yesterday, today, and forever. But neither should one ignore the New Testament theme of divine judgment, which Talbott thinks the Western theological tradition has misunderstood entirely. He argues in particular that certain patterns of fallacious reasoning, which crop up repeatedly in the works of various theologians and Bible scholars, have prevented many from appreciating St. Paul&#39;s explicit teaching that God is merciful to all in the end. This second edition of Talbott&#39;s classic work is fully revised, updated, and substantially expanded with new material.</p><p>Thomas Talbott is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon. He has published numerous articles and book chapters in defense of Christian universalism.''I am not exaggerating when I say that the first edition of this book changed my life. Its core chapters provided my despairing heart with the utterly unexpected and glorious hope that 'all will be well'--that God's victory over sin will truly be complete! This classic and compelling case for Christian universalism is now even better in this revised and expanded edition. Highly recommended!''<br>--Robin A. Parry, author of The Evangelical Universalist<br><br>''Among sustained defenses of Christian universalism, I know of no book that's as effective at presenting rigorous arguments in a manner engaging and accessible to non-specialists. The new edition retains that balance while tackling recent arguments and introducing new material--including a new chapter, 'Predestination unto Glory.' The Inescapable Love of God is public philosophy at its best: serious philosophical and theological argumentation that speaks to those for whom the question of whether God saves all is no mere academic issue but a deeply personal one.''<br>--Eric Reitan, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK<br><br>''The Inescapable Love of God is an important book. Its author, Thomas Talbott, is the leading defender of Christian universalism in the philosophical world. But this is in no way an academic work; rather, it is a remarkable combination of memoir, biblical exegesis, and popular philosophy. Talbott argues compellingly that the love of God will prevail for all whom God loves--that is, for everyone!''<br>--Tom Senor, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR<br><br>''Tom Talbott defends universal salvation with both serious biblical exegesis and philosophically sophisticated arguments. His multifaceted case for universalism has challenged my understanding of hell more than any other writer I have read. This book is essential reading for anyone involved in this vital debate.''<br>--Jerry L.

An instant classic, <em>Micro</em> pits nature against technology in vintage Crichton fashion. Completed by visionary science writer Richard Preston, this boundary-pushing thriller melds scientific fact with pulse-pounding fiction to create yet another masterpiece of sophisticated, cutting-edge entertainment.</p></p><p><br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: &#x201c;<em>Micro</em> is Anything But Small&#x201d; by James Rollins </strong> <br> <p><strong> An avid spelunker and scuba enthusiast, James Rollins holds a doctorate in veterinary medicine and is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling Sigma Force series, the most recent of which is <em>The Devil Colony</em>. </strong></p> <strong> </strong> <p>First I have to admit, Michael Crichton is why I write. In fact, if not for his books, I&#x2019;d probably still be a practicing veterinarian in Northern California, dealing with flea allergies, ear infections, and all manner of medical maladies. It was Crichton&#x2019;s stories of wild adventures, his explorations into the strange frontiers of science, and his truly ripped-from-the-headlines plotting that inspired me to set down my own scalpel and stethoscope and pick up pen and paper.</p> <p>But his influence went beyond mere heady inspiration. His books also served as a tutorial into the practicalities of storytelling. When I tackled my first novel (a deep-earth adventure titled <em>Subterranean</em>), I continually kept a copy of <em>Jurassic Park</em> on the shelf above my desk. That book became my roadmap on how to build a story&#x2019;s structure: who dies first and when, at what point do we see the first dinosaur, how do you fold science into a novel without stagnating the flow? That old copy of <em>Jurassic Park</em> remains dog-eared and heavily highlighted, and it still holds a cherished place on my bookshelf.</p> <p>So I dove into Crichton&#x2019;s latest novel, <em>Micro</em>, with some trepidation, fearing how a collaborative effort might tarnish his great body of work. Now, to be fair, I&#x2019;d also read Richard Preston&#x2019;s nonfiction masterpiece of scientific horror and intrigue, <em>The Hot Zone</em>. That book was as brilliant as it was terrifying. But still I wondered, could Preston take Crichton&#x2019;s story and truly do it justice?</p> <p>In a word: <em>YES</em>.</p> <p>In two words, <em>HELL YES.</em></p> <p><em>Micro</em> is pure Crichton. Dare I say, <em>vintage</em> Crichton, harkening back to the scientific intrigue of <em>Andromeda Strain</em>, to the exploration of the natural world covered in <em>Congo</em>, and to the adventure and thrills of <em>The Lost World</em>. As only Crichton can, he has taken a scientific concept as wild as the one he tackled in <em>Timeline</em> and exceeded in making it chillingly real. It took a clever quirk of genetics and cloning to give rise to the dinosaurs in <em>Jurassic Park</em>. Likewise, a twist of science in Micro calls forth a new horror out of the natural world&#x2014;but not just one line of threat. In this book, the entire biosphere becomes a vast and deadly playground. Its depiction is both darkly beautiful and stunningly dreadful. It is a terrain as foreign as any hostile planet, yet as close as our own backyard. To tell more would ruin a great adventure that will have you looking out your window with new eyes.</p> <p>Similarly, this lethal and toxic terrain must be traversed by a band of gutsy heroes. But in typical Crichton style, these are not elite commandos or a highly trained black ops team. They&#x2019;re simply a group of graduate students&#x2014;each uniquely talented and flawed&#x2014;gathered from various scientific disciplines: entomology, toxicology, botany, biochemistry. They must learn to combine resources and ingenuities to survive and ultimately thwart a danger threatening to break free into the world at large, all the while pursued by a sociopath as cunning as he is sadistic.</p> <p>In the end, <em>Micro</em> has everything you&#x2019;d expect in a Crichton novel&#x2014;and so much more. But the greatest achievement here is a simple and profound one: with this novel, the legacy of a true master continues to shine forth in all its multifaceted glory. And someone somewhere will read this novel, turn the last page, and in a great aura of awe and inspiration, come to a realization: <em>I want to try to write stories like that.</em></p> <p>And they will.</p><p>#1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Michael Crichton reveals a universe too small to see and too dangerous to ignore</p><p>In the locked office of a Honolulu building, three men are found dead, with no sign of struggle except for ultrafine, razor-sharp cuts covering their bodies.</p><p>In the lush rain forests of Oahu, groundbreaking technology has ushered in a revolutionary era of biological prospecting.

Michael Gaitley, MIC, has done in 33 Days to Morning Glory to promote true devotion to Mary, and what he has done in Consoling the Heart of Jesus to promote devotion to the Merciful and Sacred Heart of Jesus, he now does in &#39;You Did It to Me&#39; to promote the works of mercy.Fr. Michael Gaitley [MIC] has a genius for bringing together the spiritual and corporal works of mercy under the umbrella of &#39;The Five Scriptural Works of Mercy&#39; that Jesus will use to judge us at the end of the world, Matthew 25:31-46. He then enriches these Scriptural texts on mercy with the practical insights of St. Pope John Paul II, St. Faustina, and Pope Francis.He also has a very fertile imagination in bringing to life practical ways of implementing these works of mercy in our own individual lives, in our parish ministries as well as in the workplace, together with a plan of action for making these works of mercy concrete and livable.If implemented, these concepts will transform the culture of any parish. The simple soul will be energized to do and the contemplative soul will be inspired to intercede. I could not recommend this book more highly.&#39; - Bishop Robert J.

The authors have sought to combine a sound and accurate (but not abstract) exposition of the elementary theory of differential equations with considerable material on methods of solution, analysis, and approximation that have proved useful in a wide variety of applications. While the general structure of the book remains unchanged, some notable changes have been made to improve the clarity and readability of basic material about differential equations and their applications.</p> <p>In addition to expanded explanations, the 11th edition includes new problems, updated figures and examples to help motivate students. The program is primarily intended for undergraduate students of mathematics, science, or engineering, who typically take a course on differential equations during their first or second year of study. The main prerequisite for engaging with the program is a working knowledge of calculus, gained from a normal two?] or three?] semester course sequence or its equivalent. Some familiarity with matrices will also be helpful in the chapters on systems of differential equations.</p></p><p><p>William E.

It&#x2019;s a feeling of excitement, fear, sexual arousal, or irritation. But what we don&#x2019;t currently know is how to use charge for the behaviors we want to create.Charge is a word for the basic life force running through us. This force is crucial if we are to meet the challenges of difficult situations, heal past wounds and traumas, and manage the stress of modern life. Even more, it is essential for understanding how to master your own life force and become all you can be.This book makes an important contribution to the growing field of Energy Medicine, by looking at charge as the interface between mind and body, and the missing ingredient in Mind-Body healing. It brings the reader into a deep intimacy with their own life force, as well as an understanding of how charge runs their relationships, their children, their clients, and patients. It examines how we can become "overcharged" or "undercharged" and how to bring about balance through practices of charging and discharging. Each chapter gives simple exercises to put these principles into practice.World-renowned teacher, somatic therapist, best-selling author, and advanced yoga teacher, Anodea Judith, Ph.D., addresses all this and more in her groundbreaking book on mastering the life force. Taken from her decades of teaching on the subject and her doctoral work in Mind-Body medicine, this book contributes something entirely new to the literature on healing self and others.</p><p>Anodea Judith, Ph.D., is the author or co-author of eight books on various aspects of healing, psychology, spirituality, social change, and yoga, most notably as seen through the system of energy centers known as chakras. Her first book, released in 1987, Wheels of Life, has sold over 250,000 copies in the U.S., with translations in 24 languages, selling even better today after nearly 30 years. She holds Masters and Doctoral degrees in Psychology and Human Health, is a 500-hour registered yoga teacher (E-RYT), with lifelong studies of psychology, mythology, sociology, history, systems theory, and mystic spirituality. She is considered one of the country&#x2019;s foremost experts on the combination of chakras and therapeutic issues and on the interpretation of the Chakra System for the Western lifestyle. She teaches across the world, and has been a speaker at numerous conferences, such as Yoga Journal, Institute of Noetic Sciences, and Healing Touch, and an ongoing faculty member of The Shift Network, Kripalu Yoga Center, New York Open Center, Omega, and many other retreat centers and yoga studios. Website: http://www.anodeajudith.comIn this landmark book, Anodea Judith further addresses the role of the chakras in personality and our intimate relationships. She advances her original understanding of the energy systems of life and shows us just how we can ride the wave of charge and excitement and embody that aliveness. This journey opens the door to the inner experience of the authentic self, of our relationship to ourselves and to others. Anodea also pays particular attention to the effect that trauma has upon our vital energy centers. She then provides maps to help us move back into life, and to know and achieve what we truly want in life.<br>-Peter A.

Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover. Unfortunately, he was known more for his reputation as &#34;The Beast 666&#34; and &#34;The Wickedest Man in the World.&#34; All well and good for publicity, but this infamy eclipsed his teachings, as did his technical and opaque writing style, meant more for adepts contemporary to him than the average modern reader. Enter Lon Milo DuQuette to decipher and explain Crowley&#39;s texts and more important rituals. Formerly titled The Magick of Thelema, this revised edition features extensive corrections, a new introduction, and a new ritual, &#34;The Rites of Eleusis.&#34; This is the perfect introductory text for readers who wonder what the works--rather than the myth--of Aleister Crowley are all about. DuQuette takes the mystery out of both the rituals themselves and Crowley&#39;s writing in this modern grimoire. Step by step, he presents a course of study in plain English, with examples of rituals and explanations of their significance. DuQuette also includes a course of study for Crowley&#39;s original works with an extensive bibliography and fastidious footnotes.</p><p>Lon Milo DuQuette has been involved with occult studies since the late 60s and has become an acknowledged and widely-recognized authority within the world of modern occultism.

Suddenly his school -- along with many others across the United States -- is under attack. Gunmen burst in, slaughtering children and adults alike. This novella by New York Times bestselling author William R. Forstchen imagines a horrifying scenario where, in the course of one day, the terrorist group ISIS carries out massacres in schools and on highways across the United States. With a surprisingly small but well-organized and ruthless force, the nightmarish devastation brings America to a state of near-paralysis. Author of One Second After and Pillar to the Sky, this heart-stopping novella brings home just how fragile our defenses and infrastructure really are. It is also a story of heroic efforts to save lives, while sounding a wake-up call to American citizens and their government. From the ISIS leader in Syria, to the murderous rampages throughout the U.S., Day of Wrath reveals with chilling effect how national panic and paralyzing terror at the spiraling violence can bring a mighty country to a near-standstill. Petersen's fight to save lives and stop the merciless gunmen provides edge-of-the-seat drama. Day of Wrath is a provocative work that should stimulate an intense national debate.

Some of the dishes are robust, others are astonishingly light, all are full of heart and surprise and flavor&nbsp;&#x2014; and all are well within the reach of the home cook. <br></b><br>California has the French Laundry, Virginia has the Inn at Little Washington, and Tennessee has Blackberry Farm, where the indulgences of a luxury inn are woven together with odes to nature&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp; fly-fishing, hiking, foraging, bird watching, and heirloom gardening&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp; to create a new way of looking at the world, a way in which anything seems possible. <br><br>This is particularly true at the Inn's table and in its award-winning wine cellar. To the farm's master gardeners, food artisans and chefs, meals are an opportunity to express not only the earth and the culture of this remote spot, but also its spirit. On a spring day this might mean Rye Whiskey-Cured Trout with Fresh and Pickled Fennel, and the summer garden might inspire a Chilled Corn Soup with Garlic Custard, a papardelle of baby carrots, or a tomato terrine. In the cooler weather, game and traditionally preserved food&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp; cider-basted venison, a shell-bean and gamebird cassoulet, a dried apple stack cake or &nbsp;Bourbon Apple Fried Pies &#x2014;&nbsp; keep conversation in front of the fire lively. For all its artfulness, however, Blackberry Farm's garden-to-table cooking tends to be an ode to a well-loved cast iron skillet, a backyard smoker or a wood-fired grill. <br><br>In the foothills, you don't eat to eat, you eat to talk, to remember and to imagine what you will eat tomorrow. In this book, the stories of the people who practice the traditional mountain food arts&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp; the bacon man, the heirloom gardener, the cheese maker and sausage man&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp; are woven together with the recipes, lore and regional history to reflect the spirit of the cooking at Blackberry Farm.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly butter a baking sheet and set it aside.</p> <p>2. Divide the pastry in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece of dough into a 9-inch circle. Place the pastry on the prepared baking sheet; overlapping the two circles a little on one side is okay as the edges will be folded in later. Spread 2 tablespoons of jam evenly over each piece of pastry, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border. Arrange the figs over the jam. Cover the tarts with plastic wrap and set them aside.</p> <p>3. In a small saucepan, cook 1/3 cup of the sugar over medium-high heat without stirring until it melts and turns amber in color. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully stir in the cream and butter, stirring until the mixture is smooth. Brush the tops of the figs with the caramel mixture. Fold the edge of the pastry over the outer edge of the figs, pleating the dough to hold it in place.</p> <p>4. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and milk. Brush the edges of the pastry with the egg mixture and then sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon of sugar. Bake for about 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown and the figs are just tender. Serve warm or at room temperature, cut into generous wedges.</p> <p><b>Basic Pastry</b> </p><ul> <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li> <li>1 teaspoon salt</li> <li>1 cup plus 3 tablespoons shortening</li> <li>1 large egg</li> <li>1/3 cup plus 1 to 3 tablespoons ice water</li> <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li> </ul> <p>(Makes pastry for two 9- or 10-inch pie shells or one double-crust 9-inch pie)</p> <p>1. Place the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the shortening and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer to a medium bowl and set aside.</p> <p>2. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, 1/3 cup of the ice water, and the vinegar. Pour the egg mixture over the flour mixture and stir with a fork just until the dough comes together. If the dough is too dry, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time.</p> <p>3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently into a ball. Divide the ball in half and flatten each piece into a disk about 1 inch thick. Wrap each disk in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 3 days; the dough can also be frozen for up to 6 months and defrosted overnight in the refrigerator prior to using.</p>A member of Relais &amp; Chateaux, Blackberry Farm has won dozens of major awards for food, wine, service, and general excellence from Zagat, Travel + Leisure, Conde Nast Traveler, and Southern Living, and is frequently ranked the #1 small hotel in the United States.&nbsp; Proprietor SAM BEALL grew up on Blackberry Farm, which was founded by his parents, Kreis and Sandy Beall.

Conn Iggulden lives in Hertfordshire with his wife and their children.<i>Chapter One</i><br>ON A SPRING DAY in his twelfth year, Temujin raced his four brothers across the steppes, in the shadow of the mountain known as Deli&#x2019;un-Boldakh. The eldest, Bekter, rode a gray mare with skill and concentration, and Temujin matched his pace, waiting for a chance to go past. Behind them came Khasar, whooping wildly as he moved up on the two leaders. At ten, Khasar was a favorite in the tribe, as lighthearted as Bekter was sullen and dark. His red-mottled stallion snorted and whickered after Bekter&#x2019;s mare, making the little boy laugh. Kachiun came next in the galloping line, an eight-year-old not given to the openness that made people love Khasar. Of all of them, Kachiun seemed the most serious, even secretive. He spoke only rarely and did not complain, no matter what Bekter did to him. Kachiun had a knack with the ponies that few others could match, able to nurse a burst of speed when the rest were flagging. Temujin glanced over his shoulder to where Kachiun had positioned himself, his balance perfect. He seemed to be idling along, but they had all been surprised before and Temujin kept a close eye on him.<br><br>Already some way behind his brothers, the smallest and youngest of them could be heard calling plaintively for them to wait. Temuge was a boy with too much love for sweet things and laziness, and it showed in his riding. Temujin grinned at the sight of the chubby boy flapping his arms for more speed. Their mother had warned against including the youngest in their wild tournaments. Temuge had barely grown out of the need to be tied to the saddle, but he wailed if they left him behind. Bekter had yet to find a kind word for Temuge.<br><br>Their high voices carried far across the spring grass of the plain. They galloped flat out, with each boy perched like a bird on the ponies&#x2019; backs. Yesugei had once called them his sparrows and looked on with pride at their skill. Temujin had told Bekter that he was too fat to be a sparrow and had been forced to spend a night hiding out from the older boy&#x2019;s bad temper.<br><br>On such a day, though, the mood of the whole tribe was light. The spring rains had come and the rivers ran full again, winding across plains where dry clay had been only days before. The mares had warm milk for drinking and making into cheese and cool yoghurt. Already, the first touches of green were showing through the bones of the hills, and with it came the promise of a summer and warm days. It was a gathering year, and before the next winter, the tribes would come together in peace to compete and trade. Yesugei had decreed that this year the families of the Wolves would make the trip of more than a thousand miles to replenish their herds. The prospect of seeing the wrestlers and archers was enough to have the boys on their best behavior. The races, though, were what held them rapt and played across their imaginations as they rode. Except for Bekter, the boys had all seen their mother privately, asking Hoelun to put in a word with Yesugei. Each of them wanted to race the long distance or the sprints, to make a name for themselves and be honored.<br><br>It went unspoken that a boy who returned to his gers with a title such as &#x201c;Exalted Rider&#x201d; or &#x201c;Master of Horse&#x201d; might one day win their father&#x2019;s position when he retired to tend his herds. With the possible exception of fat Temuge, the others could not help but dream. It galled Temujin that Bekter assumed he would be the one, as if a year or two of age made a difference. Their relationship had become strained ever since Bekter had returned from his betrothal year away from the tribe. Though Temujin was still the tallest of the brothers, the older boy had grown in some indefinable way, and Temujin had found the new Bekter a humorless companion.<br><br>It had seemed an act at first to Temujin, with Bekter only pretending at maturity. The brooding boy no longer spoke without thinking and seemed to weigh every statement in his mind before he allowed it past his lips. Temujin had mocked his seriousness, but the months of winter had come and gone with no sign of an easing. There were moments when Temujin still found his brother&#x2019;s pompous moods amusing, but he could respect Bekter&#x2019;s temper, if not his right to inherit their father&#x2019;s tents and sword.<br><br>Temujin watched Bekter as he rode, careful not to let a gap grow between them. It was too fine a day to worry about the distant future, and Temujin daydreamed about all four brothers, brothers&#x2013;all five with Bekter, even&#x2013;sweeping the board of honors at the tribal gathering. Yesugei would swell with pride and Hoelun would grip them one by one and call them her little warriors, her little horsemen. Even Temuge could be entered at six years of age, though the risks of a fall were huge. Temujin frowned to himself as Bekter glanced over his shoulder, checking his lead. Despite their subtle maneuvering, Yesugei had not yet given permission for any of them to take part as the spring came.<br><br>Hoelun was pregnant again and close to the end of her time. The pregnancy had been hard on her and quite different from the ones before. Each day began and ended with her retching over a bucket until her face was speckled with spots of blood under the skin. Her sons were on their best behavior while they waited for Yesugei to cease his worried pacing outside the gers. In the end, the khan had grown tired of their stares and careful silence, sending them off to run the winter out of the horses. Temujin had continued to chatter and Yesugei had picked him up in one powerful hand and tossed him at a stallion with a white sock. Temujin had twisted in the air to land and launch into a gallop in one movement. Whitefoot was a baleful, snappy beast, but his father had known he was the boy&#x2019;s favorite.<br><br>Yesugei had watched the others mount without a sign of his pride on his broad, dark face. Like his father before him, he was not a man to show emotion, especially not to sons he could make weak. It was part of a father&#x2019;s responsibility to be feared, though there were times when he ached to hug the boys and throw them up into the air. Knowing which horses they preferred showed his affection, and if they guessed at his feelings from a glance or a light in his eye, that was no more than his own father had done years before. He valued those memories in part for their rarity and could still recall the time his father had finally grunted approval at his knots and ropework with a heavy load. It was a small thing, but Yesugei thought of the old man whenever he yanked a rope tight, his knee hard into the bales. He watched his boys ride into the bright sunshine, and when they could no longer see him, his expression eased. His father had known the need for hard men in a hard land. Yesugei knew they would have to survive battle, thirst, and hunger if they were to reach manhood. Only one could be khan of the tribe. The others would either bend the knee or leave with just a wanderer&#x2019;s gift of goats and sheep. Yesugei shook his head at the thought, gazing after the dust trail of his sons&#x2019; ponies. The future loomed over them, while they saw only the spring and the green hills.<br><br>The sun was bright on his face as Temujin galloped. He reveled in the lift in spirit that came from a fast horse straining under him, the wind in his face. Ahead, he saw Bekter&#x2019;s gray mare recover from a stumble on a loose stone. His brother reacted with a sharp blow to the side of the mare&#x2019;s head, but they had lost a length and Temujin whooped as if he were about to ride past. It was not the right moment. He loved to lead, but he also enjoyed pressuring Bekter, because of the way it annoyed him.<br><br>Bekter was already almost the man he would be, with wide, muscular shoulders and immense stamina. His betrothal year with the Olkhun&#x2019;ut people had given him an aura of worldly knowledge he never failed to exploit. It irritated Temujin like a thorn under his skin, especially when his brothers pestered Bekter with questions about their mother&#x2019;s people and their customs. Temujin too wanted to know, but he decided grimly that he would wait to find out on his own, when Yesugei took him.<br><br>When a young warrior returned from his wife&#x2019;s tribe, he was given the status of a man for the first time. When the girl came into her blood, she would be sent after him with an honor guard to show her value. A ger would be ready for her and her young husband would wait at its door to take her inside.<br><br>For the Wolves, it was tradition for the young man to challenge his khan&#x2019;s bondsmen before he was fully accepted as a warrior. Bekter had been eager and Temujin remembered watching in awe as Bekter had walked up to the bondsmen&#x2019;s fire, close to Yesugei&#x2019;s ger. Bekter had nodded to them and three men had stood to see if his time with the Olkhun&#x2019;ut had weakened him. From the shadows, Temujin had watched, with Khasar and Kachiun silent at his side. Bekter had wrestled all three of the bondsmen, one after the other, taking terrible punishment without complaint. Eeluk had been the last, and the man was like a pony himself, a wall of flat muscle and wide arms. He had thrown Bekter so hard that blood had run from one of his ears, but then to Temujin&#x2019;s surprise, Eeluk had helped Bekter up and held a cup of hot black <i>airag </i>for him to drink. Bekter had almost choked at the bitter fluid mingling with his own blood, but the warriors had not seemed to mind.<br><br>Temujin had enjoyed witnessing his older brother beaten almost senseless, but he saw too that the men no longer scorned him around the fires at night. Bekter&#x2019;s courage had won him something intangible but important. As a result, he had become a stone in Temujin&#x2019;s path. As the brothers raced across the plains under a spring sun, there was no finishing line, as there would be at the great gathering of tribes. Even if there had been, it was too soon after winter to really push their mounts. They all knew better than to exhaust the ponies before they had ...</p><h2>Transformers: IDW Collection Phase Two Volume 1</h2><p><ul> <li>The war for Cybertron is over, but Bumblebee and his fellow Autobots struggle to maintain control of a world without Optimus Prime.

Perhaps, says Matthew Bates, but we're missing pieces of the gospel. The biblical gospel can never change. Yet our understanding of the gospel must change. The church needs an allegiance shift.<br><br>Popular pastoral resources on the gospel are causing widespread confusion. Bates shows that the biblical gospel is different, fuller, and more beautiful than we have been led to believe. He explains that saving faith doesn't come through trust in Jesus's death on the cross alone but through allegiance to Christ the king. There is only one true gospel and one required response: allegiance.<br><br>Bates ignited conversation with his successful and influential book <i>Salvation by Allegiance Alone</i>. Here he goes deeper while making his acclaimed teaching on salvation more accessible and experiential for believers who want to better understand and share the gospel. <i>Gospel Allegiance</i> includes a guide for further conversation, making it ideal for church groups, pastors, leaders, and students.</p><p><b>"Zeroes in on the questions Christians are asking, or should be"<br></b><br>"We in the Protestant tradition believe the church is always reforming, but this reforming must retain a focused eye on Scripture. <i>Gospel Allegiance</i> reforms the gospel of evangelicalism by undertaking an adventurous journey through gospel texts in the New Testament. Bates challenges major pastor-theologians to give a more accurate gospel by adding his own strong voice. A must-read for the church."<br>--<b>Scot McKnight</b>, Northern Seminary; author of <i>The King Jesus Gospel</i><br><br>"Dallas Willard's dictum articulated by discipleship expert Bill Hull should guide our thoughts about discipleship: 'The Jesus we preach and the gospel we uphold will determine the disciple we get.' <i>Gospel Allegiance</i> responds on point, showing us that the biblical gospel is a comprehensive gospel."<br>--<b>Bobby Harrington</b>, founder and lead servant of Renew.org and Discipleship.org<br><br>"A stimulating and challenging book that invites us to go back to the New Testament and listen to the gospel all over again. What does the word 'faith' mean to Jesus and the apostles, and does our contemporary language about 'belief' faithfully represent their concerns? Whether or not you agree with all of his conclusions, all readers will benefit from Bates's exploration of this all-important theme in the New Testament."<br>--<b>Tim Mackie</b>, cofounder of The Bible Project<br><br>"This book cuts straight to the point, and if I'm honest, it hurts. You will find yourself simultaneously stepping back in shock and leaning in with intrigue, but at the end of the day you will find yourself on your knees in surrender to the only One worthy of your allegiance."<br>--<b>Kyle Idleman</b>, teaching pastor, Southeast Christian Church, Louisville, Kentucky; author of <i>Not a Fan</i><br><br>"Arresting and provocative, with the aim of cultivating faithfulness, Bates's newest book zeroes in on the questions Christians are asking, or should be. I am eager to give my students and my parishioners this tool so that we can all engage with the glory of the gospel afresh."<br>--<b>Amy Peeler</b>, Wheaton College<br><br>"<i>Gospel Allegiance</i> offers a simple but profound argument. Bates shows that faith is not mere belief. Rather, biblical faith is allegiance. This singular observation disentangles a number of thorny theological ideas surrounding grace and works, salvation and faith. The church will be better for it."<br>--<b>Mark&nbsp;E. Moore</b>, teaching pastor, Christ's Church of the Valley, Phoenix; author of <i>Core 52</i><b>Matthew&nbsp;W. Bates</b> (PhD, University of Notre Dame) is associate professor of theology at Quincy University in Quincy, Illinois.

These materials gently develop concepts, and the practice of those concepts is extended over a considerable period of time. This is called &#34;incremental development and continual review.&#34; Material is introduced in easily understandable pieces (increments), allowing students to grasp one facet of a concept before the next one is introduced. Both facets are then practiced together until another one is introduced. This feature is combined with continual review in every lesson throughout the year. Topics are never dropped but are increased in complexity and practiced every day, providing the time required for concepts to become totally familiar. Each grade level has its own consumable meeting book, which is used during The Meeting at the beginning of each day. This first edition meeting book is for Grade 3.</p><p></p><h2>Unexpected: Leave Fear Behind, Move Forward in Faith, Embrace the Adventure</h2><p><p>Is it possible to have peace in an uncertain world?

But often the efforts of individual units are not coordinated, resulting in conflicts, lost opportunities, and diminished performance.<br><br>Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton argue that the responsibility for this critical alignment lies with corporate headquarters. In this book, the authors apply their revolutionary Balanced Scorecard management system to corporate-level strategy, revealing how highly successful enterprises achieve powerful synergies by explicitly defining corporate headquarters&#x2019; role in setting, coordinating, and overseeing organizational strategy.<br><br>Based on extensive field research in organizations worldwide, <i>Alignment</i> shows how companies can build an enterprise-level Strategy Map and Balanced Scorecard that clearly articulate the enterprise value proposition&#x201d;: how the enterprise creates value above that achieved by individual business units operating alone. The book provides case studies, actionable frameworks, and sample scorecards that show how to align business and support units, boards of directors, and external partners with the corporate strategy and create a governance process that will ensure that alignment is sustained.<br><br>The next breakthrough in strategy execution from the field&#x2019;s premier thinkers, <i>Alignment</i> shows how today&#x2019;s companies can unlock unrealized value from enterprise synergies.</p><p><strong>Robert S.

On the afternoon of July 3, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee ordered more than 12,000 Southern infantrymen to undertake what would become the most legendary charge in American military history. This attack, popularly but inaccurately known as &#x201c;Pickett&#x2019;s Charge,&#x201d; is often considered the turning point of the Civil War&#x2019;s seminal battle of Gettysburg. Although much has been written about the battle itself and Pickett&#x2019;s Charge in particular, Pickett&#x2019;s Charge at Gettysburg is the first battlefield guide for this celebrated assault. <br><br>After the war, one staff officer perceptively observed that the charge &#x201c;has been more criticized, and is still less understood, than any other act of the Gettysburg drama.&#x201d; Unfortunately, what was true then remains true to this day. The authors of this book&#x2014;two of Gettysburg&#x2019;s elite Licensed Battlefield Guides&#x2014;have teamed up with one of the Civil War&#x2019;s leading cartographers to unravel the mysteries of this attack. <br><br>Grounded in the premise that no better resource exists for understanding this unique event than the battlefield itself, Pickett&#x2019;s Charge at Gettysburg encourages its readers to explore this storied event from a wide variety of perspectives. For the first time, readers can march toward the Copse of Trees with Armistead&#x2019;s Virginians, advance from the Confederate left with Pettigrew&#x2019;s North Carolinians, or defend the Angle with Alonzo Cushing&#x2019;s gunners and thousands of Union soldiers. There is much here to enrich the experience, including dozens of full-color original maps, scores of battlefield and other historic photographs, a unique mix of rare human interest stories, discussions of leadership controversies, a full Order of Battle, and a rare collection of artifacts directly related to the charge. <br><br>Pickett&#x2019;s Charge at Gettysburg is designed for readers to enjoy on or off the battlefield, and will give Civil War enthusiasts an entirely new appreciation for, and understanding of, Gettysburg&#x2019;s third day of battle.</p><p>James A.

If she wants to stay alive, she's got to play dead. She'll have to trust people she barely knows -- colleagues who hate her, homicide cops who want her out of the crime-fighting business, and a new love who inconveniently happens to be opposing counsel. But her knack for courting trouble makes it almost impossible for Anne to play well with others, and an unexpected event places her in lethal jeopardy and leaves her with everything to lose.</p></p><p>Anne Murphy thought she'd put her unhappy past a continent behind her when she joined Philadelphia attorney Bennie Rosato's all-woman law firm. Then a friend who's housesitting for Anne is murdered in what's clearly a case of mistaken identity, and Anne realizes that the past has caught up with her and that the only way to outrun it is to catch the killer before he realizes that she's still alive. But how can Anne play dead with a high-profile case just days away from starting? The only way to pull it off is to let her new colleagues in on the secret, which would mean telling them her other secrets, too, including the fact that she's in love with opposing counsel and the probability that her client may not be as innocent as she thought he was. The author deftly weaves the threads of plot and subplot together, helped by Mary DiNunzio, Judy Carrier, and Bennie herself, the familiar and well-drawn mainstays of this lively and solidly paced series (<i>Moment of Truth</i>, <i>The Vendetta Defense</i>, <i>Rough Justice</i>). It's vintage Scottoline, featuring some nice touches; a little suspense, a lot of female bonding, a few pithy asides on the human condition, and a surprise in the penultimate chapter. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p>Lisa Scottoline is a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and serves as president of the Mystery Writers of America.

However, recent discoveries of astonishing accomplishments from the Neolithic Age -- in art, technology, writing, math, science, religion, medicine and exploration -- demand a fundamental rethinking of humanity before the dawn of written history. <br> In this fascinating book, Richard Rudgley describes how <br> * The intrepid explorers of the Stone Age discovered all of the world's major land masses long before the so-called Age of Discovery<br> * Stone Age man performed medical operations, including amputations and delicate cranial surgeries<br> * Paleolithic cave artists of Western Europe used techniques that were forgotten until the Renaissance<br> * Prehistoric life expectancy was better than it is for contemporary third-world populations <br> Rudgley reminds us just how savage so-called civilized people can be, and demonstrates how the cultures that have been reviled as savage were truly civilized. <i>The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age</i> shows the great debt that contemporary society owes to its prehistoric predecessors. It is a rich introduction to a lost world that will redefine the meaning of civilization itself.</p><p>Among historians, one of the most widely accepted criteria for a society's being "civilized" is whether it has a writing system, one that permits complex record keeping and allows for an account of the past. By that measure, writes British museologist Richard Rudgley, many societies of the most ancient Stone Age are to be reckoned as civilizations, for new archaeological evidence suggests that the Neolithic writing systems of cultures like Mesopotamia and the Nile valley have their roots in even older systems, some dating back to the time of the Neanderthals. (Just what those writing systems say remains a matter of debate, and Rudgley acknowledges that "if a script cannot be deciphered, then it will always be possible to dismiss it.") Prehistoric sign systems aside, Rudgley urges that the chronology of human cultural evolution be pushed back well into the Paleolithic; "the most fundamental cultural innovations," he suggests, "actually occurred far earlier in the overall sequence [of human development] than is generally realized." He maintains, for instance, that fired pottery, another characteristic of civilized societies, existed among Siberian nomads some 13,000 years ago, and that a knowledge of metallurgy existed in Egypt 35,000 years ago. Any call for a revision in widely accepted chronologies is, of course, sure to be controversial among prehistorians, and Rudgley's book, well reasoned as it is, will provoke debate. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><b>Richard Rudgley</b> is an Oxford-trained scholar of Stone Age art, religion and technology.

He saw the rise of Athens to greatness under the inspired leadership of Pericles. In 430, the second year of the Peloponnesian War, he caught and survived the horrible plague which he described so graphically. Later, as general in 423 he failed to save Amphipolis from the enemy and was disgraced. He tells about this, not in volumes of self-justification, but in one sentence of his history of the war&#x2015;that it befell him to be an exile for twenty years. He then lived probably on his property in Thrace, but was able to observe both sides in certain campaigns of the war, and returned to Athens after her defeat in 404. He had been composing his famous history, with its hopes and horrors, triumphs and disasters, in full detail from first-hand knowledge of his own and others.</p><p>The war was really three conflicts with one uncertain peace after the first; and Thucydides had not unified them into one account when death came sometime before 396. His history of the first conflict, 431&#x2013;421, was nearly complete; Thucydides was still at work on this when the war spread to Sicily and into a conflict (415&#x2013;413) likewise complete in his awful and brilliant record, though not fitted into the whole. His story of the final conflict of 413&#x2013;404 breaks off (in the middle of a sentence) when dealing with the year 411. So his work was left unfinished and as a whole unrevised. Yet in brilliance of description and depth of insight this history has no superior.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Thucydides is in four volumes.</p></p><p><p>Charles Forster Smith (1852&#x2013;1931) was Professor of Greek and Classical Philology at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison.</p></p><h2>The Trouble with Highlanders (The Sutherlands Scottish Historical Romance Series, 2)</h2><p><p><b>She has hardly any choices left, and they're all dangerous...</b></p><p>With her clan on the wrong side of the struggle for the Scottish throne, heiress <strong>Daphne Macleod</strong>, once the toast of the court, is out of options. </p><p><strong>Norris Sutherland</strong>, heir to the Earl of Sutherland, once helped <strong>Daphne</strong> escape an unwanted betrothal, but she walked away from him without a backward glance. </p><p>Now after her fall from privilege and <strong>on the run from a vicious clan leader who wants to marry her, then murder her for her (supposed) hidden fortune</strong>, <strong>Daphne</strong> needs <strong>Norris</strong> more than ever.

Part of her was content, maybe even eager to sink down into the memory of being in Norris Sutherland's arms.</p> <p>"I want ye demanding and passionate, nae filled with duty, lass..."</p> <p>She twisted again, feeling his arms around her. His strength had been impressive and arousing. Never had she imagined how much she'd enjoy being pressed against a man, beneath him or when she decided to straddle his hips and take charge of their pace. Just as long as she felt his hands holding her as though letting her go might devastate him.</p> <p>"And I want ye to stop telling me what to do..."</p> <p>Need and yearning filled her. It traveled along her body, teasing parts of her she hadn't known could feel so good. The sensation was building, twisting tighter as her body neared the point where it would burst into a shower of pleasure.</p> <p>Instead, she jerked out of her sleep, escaping the hold of the dream only to discover that her freedom was cold and dark. She pressed her fist against her mouth to silence her cry. The chamber was silent, and yet it felt as though Norris was in it. She could sense him, would swear she felt him close enough to reach out and touch.</p> <p>But there was no need to light a candle. The wind rattled the window shutters, blowing inside through the broken glass to chill her arms. She lay back down and pulled the bedding up. Her thick comforter was a luxury, and she snuggled beneath it gratefully. But her belly growled, reminding her there had been little comfort set out at supper. The stew the cook produced had been more water than anything else, but it had needed to fill many bowls.</p> <p>It was a sure bet Norris Sutherland, heir to the Earldom of Sutherland, wasn't awake in the dark hours of the morning with an empty belly. Even his accommodations in a military camp had been grand, the bed on which he'd taken her maidenhead a comfortable one.</p> <p>Ye mean the one ye joined him on as his lover...</p> <p>She closed her eyes and ordered herself to sleep while she might. The summer days were long, and there was much to do. Once winter closed its icy fist around the Highlands, there would be naught to do but seek out her bed for warmth.</p> <p>She certainly wouldn't be seeking out Norris Sutherland. No. She might have enjoyed the time she spent in his bed, but she could not ever forget that she had gone there to avoid wedding a man who loved another. She must not forget, because a man such as Norris certainly did not lack for willing bed partners. She would not join the ranks of his mistresses.</p> <p>Even if she did dream of the man.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Dunrobin Castle, Sutherland</p> <p>"Is there anything else ye desire, me laird?"</p> <p>The serving girl was pretty, and she had curves in all the places Norris liked women to have them. Her dress was open enough to allow him a generous view of her breasts.</p> <p>"Nae."</p> <p>Disappointment flashed across her face, her gaze sweeping his chest before she picked up his empty mug and placed it on her serving tray. When she turned around, he was treated to a view of her backside as she descended the four steps leading down from the high-table landing to the floor of the great hall.</p> <p>Yes, definitely curves in all the right places, and she moved with a sultry motion that should have sent heat through his veins. But his cock lay slack and uninterested beneath his kilt. He reached for the fresh mug of ale the serving lass had delivered but didn't lift it to his lips. This was becoming tiresome-exceedingly so.</p> <p>He scanned the hall, catching the smiles of other lasses all watching him to see if he would summon them forward. There were dark-haired ones and blondes, even a redhead, but none of them sparked even a twitch from his cock. The thing had been useless for nearly three months.</p> <p>"I'm growing worried about ye, me boy."</p> <p>There was only one man who would call him boy and not get smashed in the face for it. Norris stood as his father appeared from the archway that led to his private study that was hidden behind the raised floor at the end of the great hall. Norris had helped outfit the room to give his father a sanctuary when he needed a few moments of rest. It would never do for the Highland earl to appear fatigued in front of his clan. The chamber had become the earl's favorite for business, but Norris did wonder if part of the appeal was being able to sneak up on his son.</p> <p>Lytge Sutherland walked straight to his chair, even if he did it slowly. Norris didn't sit until his father was settled in the huge, ornately carved chair set at the center of the high table. Even so late at night, they showed respect to each other, for there were many watching.</p> <p>"Ye have naught to worry about, Father."</p> <p>Lytge reached for the mug of ale Norris had left untasted and drew off a long draught. He nodded then set it down. "Nonsense. Ye have nae been the same since returning from Sauchieburn." His father settled against the high back of the chair. "I went to so much trouble to secure ye that royal-blooded bride. Ye allowed her to ride out of here wearing the colors of the MacNicols."</p> <p>"She was in love with Broen MacNicols..."</p> <p>Lytge stroked his beard. "Ah yes. The same reason young Daphne MacLeod used to explain why she did nae wed Broen MacNicols as her father arranged. Ye seem to have helped Broen twice in the matter: once by taking Daphne to yer bed so she could be disgraced, and again when ye allowed yer own bride to escape the consummation of yer union."</p> <p>Norris reached for the mug and took a swig. "I wondered how long it would take ye to hear of the part I played in helping Broen out of his betrothal with Daphne."</p> <p>His father grinned, as arrogant as any man half his age, but his hair was completely gray now. "I've known, boy. Everything ye do is important to me."</p> <p>There were men who would have bristled, but Norris returned his father's grin. "Sometimes helping out a friend is a pleasant duty."</p> <p>His sire's eyebrows rose. "I imagine it was a fine bit of fun to help Daphne MacLeod lose her virtue so her betrothal might be broken, but what did ye gain from it? What did you bring home to yer clan, me boy?"</p> <p>Norris felt the bite of his father's displeasure. It was there, glittering in the older man's eyes. What made it sting was that his father wasn't railing at him. The subtle stab was more wounding than a raised voice rich with insults, because his father was speaking to him like the future leader of the clan. A laird never forgot to weigh the benefits of any situation.</p> <p>"Securing the loyalty of Laird MacNicols is worthy of note," Norris offered.</p> <p>His father nodded. "Aye, it is."</p> <p>"And Clarrisa may have been royal-blooded, but she did nae come with a dowry," Norris finished.</p> <p>"True enough. But blood has its worth. Why do ye think I keep Gahan near? He's me bastard, and Sutherland blood is valuable. Yer bride may have cost me, but she was a York bastard, and yer offspring would have been kin to the King of England." His father tilted his head to one side and returned to stroking his beard. "The MacLeod lass, according to Gahan, she's a fair sight to behold."</p> <p>"A fact she despises."</p> <p>His father chuckled. "That's her youth blinding her. Time will steal her beauty soon enough. Ye learn that by my age. Best to enjoy what ye have when ye have it. I hear ye did that well enough when the lass was in yer keeping."</p> <p>She'd been passionate too. Norris looked toward the hearth and signaled one of the serving girls forward to avoid having his father witness the flare of excitement that went through him. Daphne had blonde hair but dark eyes, which fascinated him. When he locked gazes with her, he had the sudden feeling he might lose himself in those dark orbs and be shielded from all life's travails. He'd never been one to shirk his duty, but he would not deny how tempting it was to seek her out again and lose himself in her enchanting embrace until dawn broke the spell.</p> <p>"Gahan seems to have had a great deal to tell ye," Norris groused.</p> <p>"As I said, he has his uses, and being the head of yer retainers is one of them," Lytge stated. "But he is nae the only source of information I have. In fact, Daphne MacLeod is the subject of interest at many a table in the Highlands. The rumor is that the lass has a fortune for a dowry, one nae discovered when the MacLeod land was raided by those clans who claimed victory at Sauchieburn."</p> <p>"Who raided her lands?" Norris demanded.</p> <p>"Comyn, Campbell, Lindsey. Does it matter? Her father fought on the losing side, and those who backed the young king took their pay out of the lands of those clans who did nae make so wise a choice."</p> <p>Rage heated up inside Norris. It turned white-hot before becoming a rapid boil.</p> <p>"Why do ye care, Son?"</p> <p>His father was astute and too keen for Norris's mood. The serving girl delivered another mug of ale, and he lifted it to his lips. "It does nae matter."</p> <p>"A fortune for a dowry matters. I hear her father had a bastard, and the man is set to inherit the MacLeod lairdship. Being wed to his only sister would be a good alliance." Lytge leaned forward and lowered his voice. "If there is a fortune involved, that is."</p> <p>Norris sat up, the idea immediately taking root in his head. He realized he shouldn't, but still he couldn't seem to squash the urge to see Daphne again. No, he wanted to let that urge loose and follow it.</p> <p>"Perhaps I'll ride out and see if it's true."</p> <p>His father grinned. "And ye think she'll tell ye? Do nae be thinking one night between her thighs will endear her to ye."</p> <p>His cock was hardening. His temper rose along with the organ. Still, he stood. Becoming a slave to his impulses was dangerous, but the opportunity was simply too tempting to ignore. He winked at his father. "Then maybe I'll have to charm me way into her bed again."</p> <p>***</p> <p>"I do nae take orders from ye."</p> <p>Daphne MacLeod had heard the same from more than one of her father's retainers. She sweetened her expression, fighting back the urge to call the man a fool.</p> <p>"I am suggesting ye recognize the logic in helping me round up the sheep before they stray too close to Comyn land. Their wool will be one of the few things we can harvest this season."</p> <p>Keith MacLeod frowned. "Better that ye should have used those honey-coated looks on Broen MacNicols. If ye had wed him, we'd nae have suffered being raided after the battle of Sauchieburn. If ye were the wife of another Highland laird, no one would have dared even to think about taking what was ours."</p> <p>"My father stood on the defeated side," Daphne argued, dropping all hints of sweetness. "We'd have been raided, have no doubt. My actions had naught to do with that."</p> <p>"But we'd have a strong ally to protect us. One that might have made some of the smaller clans think twice before trifling with us. The MacNicols are vassals of Sutherland."</p> <p>"So are we." Daphne lifted her head, drawing her back straight and glaring at the men standing before her. "I believe we are strong, and I will go after the sheep myself. I am not afraid, nor am I content to sit here and pity me plight. We were raided and have lost much-all the more reason to make sure we lose no more."</p> <p>She turned her back on Keith. She could feel him and his men staring at her, but she never faltered. Her cousins were still seated at the tables that filled the great hall. All three of them claimed they were the rightful heir to the MacLeod lairdship, and they were using their blood ties to her father to spend the day doing nothing of value. She passed them, but not without shooting them a hard look. They might label her many things, but they would not call her a coward.</p> <p>Gitta waited where the great hall ended and the hallway began.</p> <p>"Ye are nae endearing yerself to the men."</p> <p>Daphne didn't slow her pace. "If they cannae see the need for us to work together to pull in enough of a harvest to survive the coming winter, I have no time for them. Arrogance and pride will nae fill bellies. Me brother is nae here. I am."</p> <p>Winter would close in on them too soon. Most of the seed grain had been stolen, and what fields were planted had been trampled. Some of the young plants were recovering, but time had been lost, and the yield would not be great.</p> <p>"Ye should nae go riding. What if ye're carrying?" Gitta whispered, panting from the exertion of keeping up with her.</p> <p>"I am nae with child." However, Daphne did slow her pace, and her cheeks heated with shame for making the older woman rush.</p> <p>"Ye've nae bled," Gitta insisted. "A Sutherland bastard would give us an alliance-a great one, if it were a son. The Sutherlands keep their blood close." Gitta looked at Daphne's belly, reaching out to smooth the fabric of her skirt flat.</p> <p>Daphne flinched, jumping back a step. "Enough. If I am with child, it will nae be a matter to worry about for many months. Today our sheep are happily on their way off our land with their winter coats still on their backs. We need that wool to buy seed for next year. I will return soon." She left Gitta at the tower steps and stalked toward the stable.</p> <p>She couldn't think about a possible child. Norris Sutherland was wed. The news had traveled quickly. What bothered her most was how upset she was to know he was bound to another woman. Hadn't she suffered enough at the expense of fate? Everything she'd done had been for the right reasons. If she were shallow or greedy she'd happily have wed Broen MacNicols without a care for the fact that he was fighting with his best friend over her, or that when he discovered her still alive, the man was in love with another woman. Oh no, she would not have cared one bit how unhappy he was in their marriage. Legally, the man had been bound to wed her.</p> <p>Yet she did not lament her actions to set him free of the contract her father had made with him.</p> <p>Ye enjoyed the duty sure enough...</p> <p>Her cheeks heated, and her pace quickened. She'd let Norris Sutherland seduce her so Broen MacNicols might renounce her and wed the woman he loved. Their night of passion had served a purpose. She had no reason to be upset over Norris Sutherland's taking a bride. The man owed her no affection.</p> <p>Keith wasn't the only man wearing her father's colors who resented her choices. But a child? She didn't need the guilt of knowing she'd forced an innocent to wear the label of bastard. Even being the child of Norris Sutherland, heir to the earldom, wouldn't save it from scorn. She smoothed her hand over her belly, searching for proof that it wasn't rounding.</p> <p>What she needed was for her courses to arrive and silence the rumors, but they had never been predictable, so there was no way of knowing if she were late or not. If she bled, it would make her happy, but she feared it would be yet another reason for her people to resent her.</p> <p>At least the horses greeted her kindly. She rubbed the velvet muzzle of one and muttered softly to it.</p> <p>"Shall we go and sample some of the fine summer wea...</p></p><h2>Letters and Panegyricus I, Books 1-7 (Loeb Classical Library) (Volume I)</h2><p><p>The Younger Pliny was born in 61 or 62 CE, the son of Lucius Caecilius of Comum (Como) and the Elder Pliny's sister. He was educated at home and then in Rome under Quintilian. He was at Misenum at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 (described in two famous letters) when the Elder Pliny died.</p><p>Pliny started his career at the Roman bar at the age of eighteen. He moved through the regular offices in a senator's career, held two treasury appointments and a priesthood, and was consul in September and October 100. On this occasion he delivered the speech of thanks to the Emperor Trajan which he afterwards expanded and published as the <i>Panegyricus</i>. After his consulship he returned to advocacy in the court and Senate, and was also president of the Tiber Conservancy Board. His hopes of retirement were cut short when he was chosen by Trajan to go out to the province of Bithynia and Pontus on a special commission as the Emperor's direct representative. He is known to have been there two years, and is presumed to have died there before the end of 113. Book X of the Letters contains his correspondence with Trajan during this period, and includes letters about the early Christians.</p><p>Pliny's Letters are important as a social document of his times. They tell us about the man himself and his wide interests, and about his many friends, including Tacitus, Martial and Suetonius. Pliny has a gift for description and a versatile prose style, and more than any of his contemporaries he gives an unprejudiced picture of Rome as he knew it.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Pliny the Younger is in two volumes; the second contains Books VIII&#x2013;X of his Letters and <i>Panegyricus.</i></p></p><p><p>Betty Radice (1912&#x2013;1985) was Editor of Penguin Classics.</p></p><h2>The Zionist Idea: A Historical Analysis and Reader</h2><p>A classic since its initial publication in 1959, The Zionist Idea is an anthology of writings by the leading thinkers of the Zionist movement, including Theodor Herzl, Ahad Ha-Am, Martin Buber, Louis Brandeis, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, Judah Magnes, Max Nordau, Mordecai Kaplan, Vladimir Jabotinsky, Chaim Weizmann, and David Ben-Gurion.</p><p><p>rtzberg /f Arthur /r ed.</p>This 1960 "historical analysis and reader" gathers the writings of the most important Zionists of the time.

It is an account of the fourteen-year aftermath of a complete and irrevocable shattering of personal identity, a permanent switching off and falling away of everything.

Barash and Judith Eve Lipton dispel the notion that monogamy comes naturally. In fact, as <i>The Myth of Monogamy</i> reveals, biologists have discovered that for nearly every species, cheating is the rule -- for both sexes.</p><p>Reviewing findings from the same DNA fingerprinting science employed in the courtroom, Barash and Lipton take readers from chickadee nests to chimpanzee packs to explain why animals cheat. (Some prostitute themselves for food or protection, while others strive to couple with genetically superior or multiple mates.) <i>The Myth of Monogamy</i> then illuminates the implications of these dramatic new findings for humans, in our relationships, as parents, and more. </p><p><i>The Myth of Monogamy</i> at last brings scientific insight into this emotionally charged aspect of the ultimate dating and marriage quandary.</p></p><p>Shattering deeply held beliefs about sexual relationships in humans and other animals, <i>The Myth of Monogamy</i> is a much needed treatment of a sensitive issue. Written by the husband and wife team of behavioral scientist David P. Barash and psychiatrist Judith Eve Lipton, it glows with wit and warmth even as it explores decades of research undermining traditional precepts of mating rituals. Evidence from genetic testing has been devastating to those seeking monogamy in the animal kingdom; even many birds, long prized as examples of fidelity, turn out to have a high incidence of extra-pair couplings. Furthermore, now that researchers have turned their attention to female sexual behavior, they are finding more and more examples of aggressive adultery-seeking in "the fairer sex." Writing about humans in the context of parental involvement, the authors find complexity and humor:<p> </p><blockquote> Baby people are more like baby birds than baby mammals. To be sure, newborn cats and dogs are helpless, but this helplessness doesn't last for long. By contrast, infant <i>Homo sapiens</i> remain helpless for months ... and then they become helpless toddlers! Who in turn graduate to being virtually helpless youngsters. (And then? Clueless adolescents.) So there may be some payoff to women in being mated to a monogamous man, after all. </blockquote><p> Careful to separate scientific description from moral prescription, Barash and Lipton still poke a little fun at our conceptions of monogamy and other kinds of relationships as "natural" or "unnatural." Shoring themselves up against the inevitable charges that their reporting will weaken the institution of marriage, they make sure to note that monogamy works well for most of those who desire it and that one of our uniquely human traits is our ability to overcome biology in some instances. If, as some claim, monogamy has been a tool used by men to assert property rights over women, then perhaps one day <i>The Myth of Monogamy</i> will be seen as a milestone for women's liberation. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><p><b>David P.

I give it up of my own free will."</p> <p>John 10:18</p> <p>The angel had been ordered to make his choice. It had to be of his own free will. But what they asked of him carried a high price. He would most likely never return. Most likely be destroyed. Or worse.</p> <p>And no one would ever know the truth.</p> <p>"You have decided, then," a voice said to him.</p> <p>I felt each moment as the angel did-the obscured version of time in what had to be an otherworldly place-but could see nothing. It was surreal; no people were visible-just their presence, or maybe auras.</p> <p>It wasn't a question, what was said. They knew the moment he'd made the decision. They probably knew before him. He could sense them all around, the mighty Seraphim. Supreme knowledge lent them a powerful presence, but it was bitter this day.</p> <p>"When the first of your tasks is complete, you will move on to the next. You must not reveal yourself or seek companionship with anyone, especially exiles, unless for the purposes of fulfilling your objectives."</p> <p>"I understand."</p> <p>"You will spend three years before the day on which you must act arrives. He has his role to play. It is not possible without your actions first."</p> <p>"I understand."</p> <p>And he did understand. He had made this decision of his own free will, despite the sacrifice, for he knew it had only been asked of him because he was the perfect choice.</p> <p>He felt the universe around him, the freedom of unfettered dominion over space and realm, and wondered when he would again feel this, if ever.</p> <p>"Take a name of the times when you are there. Now go."</p> <p>And so it was. He made the transition amid images of mobs and anger. To his destiny. To death. The flash of a kiss. All things to come.</p> <p>A fog cleared around me and my surroundings came into view. I was suddenly in my art studio. Standing by the window was a figure I recognized. The one I suspected was my angel maker.</p> <p>"What's your name?" I asked, still amazed by the way my words seemed to float through the air in these dreams, as if they had their own physical presence.</p> <p>"It does not matter. But you may call me Lochmet if you require a title."</p> <p>"What does that mean?"</p> <p>"Warrior."</p> <p>I swallowed, suddenly nervous. The way he said it, with such force and confidence, made him seem so powerful.</p> <p>"Why did you show me that angel? I don't get it."</p> <p>"Not yet. But you will. It is but a strand of one existence, from a very long time ago."</p> <p>"No, please don't...Just tell me."</p> <p>He turned to face me, his shoulders squared, and I struggled with conflicting urges-one drawing me toward him, the other, to cower away. I was sure he could see it, see right through me, which only made me more vulnerable.</p> <p>"We all have the capacity to find the will to do what must be done-even when that which we must do terrifies us most. Remember this."</p> <p>"That's it? That doesn't explain anything. Who was he? I thought it was against angel law to exile to earth. How come the Seraphim asked it of that angel?"</p> <p>He considered me for another delayed, vacant moment before his head tilted toward a painting beside him. The vision of a sandy beach with a midnight blue sea crashing against rocks seemed to affect him. He stretched his arm out and brushed his fingers lightly across the textured ripples of the oil-painted canvas. For just a moment, the silence between us was almost comfortable.</p> <p>But when he looked back at me, I knew: he wasn't going to tell me any more about the angel he had shown me.</p> <p>"Be mindful. A traitor is within your fold," he said.</p> <p>"Who?"</p> <p>He shook his head and turned back to the window.</p> <p>"You must walk your path; leave the footprints as evidence of your journey. I cannot take it...or change it."</p> <p>His voice held the first hint of emotion-a small, almost undetectable, quiver.</p> <p>"But you did help me," I started. "Two years ago, in that classroom..." Even in my dream, I felt the sickening memories and the lump in my throat willing me not to go on. "It couldn't have been anyone else. You sent that teacher across the school to intervene."</p> <p>I swallowed hard, fought to hold onto my train of thought, not detour to that day, to that teacher holding me down while I struggled beneath his heavy weight.</p> <p>"You interfered," I said, then dropped my head. "Thank you."</p> <p>His silence was all the confirmation I needed. I looked around the room, unsure what to say next. My paintings surrounded me, but unlike before, they now included those that I had only planned, envisioned. Somehow, this room held the paintings of my imagination.</p> <p>I shuddered.</p> <p>From behind me, I heard a roar. The deepest rumble, so strong it reverberated up my legs and into my spine.</p> <p>"My lion," I whispered.</p> <p>I spun around in dreamy slow motion. There was nothing there. I turned back to the angel. He was gone. Sprinkles of rain spattered in through the crack in the window.</p> <p>I stood, waiting.</p> <p>And then everything around me exploded in a flash of color that settled to nothing. I was nowhere, all alone apart from the rain, startlingly cold, stinging my face with every sharp landing.</p> <p>Shards of ice.</p> <p>Cold enough to wake me up.</p></p><h2>The Waterman&#39;s Song: Slavery and Freedom in Maritime North Carolina</h2><p>The first major study of slavery in the maritime South, <i>The Waterman's Song</i> chronicles the world of slave and free black fishermen, pilots, rivermen, sailors, ferrymen, and other laborers who, from the colonial era through Reconstruction, plied the vast inland waters of North Carolina from the Outer Banks to the upper reaches of tidewater rivers. Demonstrating the vitality and significance of this local African American maritime culture, David Cecelski also reveals its connections to the Afro-Caribbean, the relatively egalitarian work culture of seafaring men who visited nearby ports, and the revolutionary political tides that coursed throughout the black Atlantic. <br><br>Black maritime laborers played an essential role in local abolitionist activity, slave insurrections, and other antislavery activism. They also boatlifted thousands of slaves to freedom during the Civil War. But most important, Cecelski says, they carried an insurgent, democratic vision born in the maritime districts of the slave South into the political maelstrom of the Civil War and Reconstruction.<br><br></p><p>"A fine book, refreshing in its scope even as it attends wonderfully to the details of local life. . . . A careful, persuasive study, one that will be immensely helpful to those seeking to understand both the diversity of southern slavery and the ways in which slaves embraced, shaped, and used a militant political culture."-- <i>Journal of American History</i> <br>David S.

It concerns itself with universal philosophical questions rather than events in the history of Israel and in the Hebrews&#x2019; covenant with God. Koheleth, the speaker in this book, ruminates on what&#x2014;if anything&#x2014;has lasting value, and how&#x2014;if at all&#x2014;God interacts with humankind. Koheleth expresses bewilderment and frustration at life&#x2019;s absurdities and injustices. He grapples with the inequities that pervade the world and the frailty and limitations of human wisdom and righteousness. His awareness of these discomfiting facts coexists with a firm belief in God&#x2019;s rule and God&#x2019;s fundamental justice, and he looks for ways to define a meaningful life in a world where so much is senseless. Ecclesiastes is traditionally read on the Jewish holiday Sukkot, the harvest festival. <p></p><p></p></p><p>The latest in the authoratative JPS Bible Commentary seriesMichael V.

This fascinating work presents the first comprehensive analysis of New Age Religion and its historical backgrounds, thus providing a means of orientation in the bewildering variety of the movement. Making extensive use of primary sources, the author thematically analyses New Age beliefs from the perspective of the study of religions. While looking at the historical backgrounds of the movement, he convincingly argues that its foundations were laid by so-called western esoteric traditions during the Renaissance. Hanegraaff finally shows how the modern New Age movement emerged from the increasing secularization of those esoteric traditions during the nineteenth century.</p><p><p>Wouter J.

Now, in this very accessible report, readers can get the facts. Formed in May 2009, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) is a panel of 10 commissioners with experience in business, regulations, economics, and housing, chosen by Congress to explain what happened and why it happened. This panel has had subpoena power that enabled them to interview people and examine documents that no reporter had access to. The FCIC has reviewed millions of pages of documents, and interviewed more than 600 leaders, experts, and participants in the financial markets and government regulatory agencies, as well as individuals and businesses affected by the crisis. In the tradition of The 9/11 Commission Report, &#34;The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report&#34; will be a comprehensive book for the lay reader, complete with a glossary, charts, and easy-to-read diagrams, and a timeline that includes important events. It will be read by policy makers, corporate executives, regulators, government agencies, and the American people.</p><p>Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission<p>"Slate," December 2010<br> "With those books, you'll never need to read anything that emerges from the FCIC. But if you do, read the good stuff: the interviews in which it grilled executives from Wall Street and the housing industry. The commission called in the loan-makers and bankers that caused the crisis and forced them to answer questions about their businesses all for the public record. (It also subpoenaed thousands of pages of documents from Wall Street firms, though it is not clear if it will make those public.) There's no need to get the narrative from the FCIC. But if you want, say, to hear former Lehman CEO Dick Fuld try to defend himself, that's the place to go. </p><p>"NPR s Morning Edition"<br> The majority report reads a lot like a book, and a bit of a potboiler at that. The commission conducted hundreds of hours of interviews, with industry insiders, policymakers, whistle-blowers and regulators. And the pages of the majority's report are strewn with quotes from these interviews foreboding, eye-popping quotes. "New York Times," February 2, 2011<br> The report is full of fascinating information, rich detail and fine documentary evidence. "New York Times," January 30, 2011 The report still makes for compelling reading because so little has changed as a result of the debacle, in both banking and in its regulation. "Minneapolis"" Star-Tribune," January 29, 2011 At 662 pages, the FCIC report amounts to a sweeping forensic examination of a crisis that the commission says could have been avoided. The conclusions are written with style and infused with an appropriate tone of outrage, buttressed by more than 700 interviews (including one with Minnesota lawyer Prentiss Cox) and millions of documents.

Fleeing to Philadelphia, he fashions a ghostly existence in an underground train station. When a young woman appears to free him from his malaise, they return together to the Iowa heartland, where the novel soars to its heartrending climax. First published to enormous acclaim in 1975, <i>Rock Island Line</i> brings Rhodes's striking characterizations and unparalleled eye for the telling detail to this tale of paradise lost &#x2014; and possibly regained.</p><p>(Starred Review) Three generations feel the pull of the land in tiny Sharon Center, Iowa, yet for all the fecundity of the soil and the river, the Montgomerys do not flourish. Wilson, the town&#39;s reticent but kind grocer, lives contentedly enough with schoolteacher Della. Their son, John, seeks truth in his work as a mechanic and marries a profoundly sensual woman. John&#39;s son, July, feels safe on the axis between order and wildness. As the Montgomery saga slowly and dramatically unfurls and darkens, Rhodes is mesmerizing, his narrative style at once utterly natural and extraordinarily complex as he shifts points of view, inlays stories within stories, and brings July into the harsh light of the foreground in the wake of shocking deaths that leave him alone and inconsolable. He rises from a resourceful street urchin to a young man of promise, but there is no escaping the &#34;death business&#34;; July&#39;s fate is noose-shaped, and no sense can be made of it. Rhodes writes with both symphonic grandeur and down-to-earth humility in this galvanizing novel of &#34;the quick, naked bones of survival.&#34; This is a descent into grief as resonant as James Agee&#39;s, an embrace of the heartland spirit as profound as Cather&#39;s and Marilynne Robinson&#39;s, a story that echoes Dreiser, Steinbeck, Gardner, and Bellow--and an authentically great American novel in its own right. -- Donna Seaman --Booklist, September 1, 2008</p><h2>Havoc (Philip Mercer)</h2><p>New Jersey, 1937: A homicidal madman bears a safe holding a terrible secret that is thought lost when fiery fate intervenes.

Trying to add as much adventure to his life as he does to his novels, Du Brul has climbed Masada at noon, swam in the Arctic Ocean off Point Barrow, explored war-torn Eritrea, camped in Greenland, and was gnawed on by piranhas in the Amazon River.

Jack Du Brul lives in Burlington, Vermont.Fans of Phillip Mercer, sometime geologist, sometime soldier of fortune, won't be unhappy with this latest installment in the series. Once again, Mercer is portrayed by J. Charles, who has a clear, resonant voice. This time Mercer is called upon to unearth a seventy-year-old secret that is linked to a current act of terrorism. DuBrul cleverly offers an alternative explanation for the 1937 destruction of the Nazi zeppelin HINDENBURG at Lakehurst, New Jersey.

A recent Harvard University study on pediatric end-of-life care has shown that the medical community is failing such children and their families.

Without relying on faith, mysticism, or science (none of which, according to Dr. Adler, can prove or disprove the existence of God), he uses a rationalist argument to lead the reader to a point where he or she can see that the existence of God is not necessarily dependent upon a suspension of disbelief. Dr. Adler provides a nondogmatic exposition of the principles behind the belief that God, or some other supernatural cause, has to exist in some form.

Now Robert Jay Lifton offers a vivid and disturbing case in point in this chilling exploration of Aum Shinrikyo, the Japanese cult that released sarin nerve gas in the Tokyo subways. </p><p>With unprecedented access to former Aum members, Lifton has produced a pathbreaking study of the inner life of a modern millennial cult. He shows how Aum's guru Shoko Asahara (charismatic spiritual leader, con man, madman) created a religion from a global stew of New Age thinking, ancient rituals, and apocalyptic science fiction, then recruited scientists as disciples and set them to producing weapons of mass destruction. Taking stock as well of Charles Manson, Heaven's Gate, and the Oklahoma City bombers, Lifton confronts the frightening possibility of a twenty-first century in which cults and terrorists may be able to bring about their own holocausts. <br>Bold and compelling, Destroying the World to Save It charts the emergence of a new global threat of urgent concern to us all.</p></p><p>The premise of <i>Destroying the World to Save It</i> is terrifying: after studying the history of the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo (instigators of a 1995 nerve gas attack on a Tokyo subway), the author believes them to be only one group in a "loosely connected, still-developing global subculture of apocalyptic violence." We ignore this subculture, says National Book Award winner Robert Jay Lifton, at our future peril. In interviews with former Aum members once led by the guru figure Shoko Asahara, it is their "familiar ordinariness" that most disturbs Lifton. Drawing parallels to his studies of Nazi psychology, he notes that--just as in Germany--practicing doctors and trained scientists were persuaded to join Aum and offer their specialized knowledge in the service of the cult's plans. The story of Aum, says Lifton, has for the first time shown the world that not only other states but more elusive groups less open to diplomacy may be able to gain control of weapons of mass destruction. <p> While <i>Destroying the World to Save It</i> is a deeply researched and intelligent psychological analysis, Lifton's conclusion is nevertheless unsatisfying. While surmising that those who next attempt to carry out an apocalyptic plan may be more powerful and competent than Aum, he does not really present a good suggestion for how to prevent their success, offering only a psychologist's "plea for awareness." One hopes his study will encourage activism against global terrorism as well. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p><p>A distinguished professor of psychology and psychiatry at John Jay College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, Robert Jay Lifton is the author of many important works, including <i>The Nazis' Doctors</i>, winner of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize, and <i>Death in Life</i>, winner of the National Book Award.</p></p><h2>They Saw the Elephant</h2><p><p>"The phrase &#x2019;seeing the elephant&#x2019; symbolized for &#x2019;49 gold rushers the exotic, the mythical, the once-in-a-lifetime adventure, unequaled anywhere else but in the journey to the promised land of fortune: California.

Maybe for others but not for her. But then he smiled at her and it was as if she'd found a piece of herself that she didn't know was missing. When he took her in his arms and held her close, she knew that for the first time in her life, she was home.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Savannah Wilson closed the book and sighed. No one, but no one, wrote a love story that hit her in all the feels like Destiny Swann did. The woman plucked her heartstrings like a virtuoso playing a sonata.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Savy, come on," Maisy Kelly said as she entered the room. She slapped Savannah's feet off the coffee table, grabbed her arm, and hauled her up to stand, which was no small feat given that Maisy was the short side of petite and Savannah was more Amazonian in height and build.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm reading," Savannah said. She held up her book. "Isn't that sacred time? You own a bookstore; I would think you of all people would respect that."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maisy glanced at the book. Then she crossed her hands over her heart and said, "Oh, <i>Her One and Only</i>, that's one of my favorite Destiny Swann books. I totally get it, I do, but you're my sous-chef, and I need you in the kitchen. Besides, you shouldn't be hiding in the parlor when we have a house full of people coming for Thanksgiving dinner."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm not hiding. I'm just not very good company right now," Savannah said. She tossed the book onto the coffee table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Work stuff?" Maisy asked. She tipped her head to the side and studied Savy through the black-framed rectangular glasses she always wore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, but it's not about the bookstore. It's stuff about my old job in New York, and I don't want to talk about it," Savy said. "Thus, the book."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Escapism 101?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm getting an A," she said. "Although, Swann does set the bar pretty high in the hero department. I mean what man could possibly live up to Tag McAllister? He's smart, kind, devoted to his grandmother, and completely swoon-worthy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Maisy, where do you want me to put my famous smashed potatoes with green chilies?" Joaquin Solis called from the doorway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maisy glanced at him and then turned toward Savannah with her eyebrows raised above the frames of her glasses as if to say, <i>Him</i>. Savannah shook her head. It made her long wavy red hair, which she'd twisted into a sloppy knot on the top of her head, unravel and fall down around her shoulders. She glanced at the man in the doorway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was watching her as if he could happily do so for the rest of the day, never mind the Crock-Pot of mashed potatoes he held in his hands. This little bit of domesticity only added to the package of hotness that was Joaquin Solis, but Savannah was immune to him. Mostly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She could, in a completely objective way, acknowledge that he had a certain something, sort of like acknowledging that diamonds were sparkly and chocolate was yummy. It didn't mean she was going to partake of either and break her bank account or add some squish to her middle. She had greater willpower than that. Still, Joaquin, Quino to his friends, was the sort of man who made girls with good intentions do naughty things and not regret it one little bit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tall with broad shoulders, he sported a thick thatch of dark hair, chiseled features, and eyes so dark they appeared bottomless. Joaquin was the sort of man women noticed. If it wasn't his rugged good looks and honed physique, it was his wicked sense of humor and flirty ways that made ladies fan themselves when he walked by with a casual wink and his charmer's grin. It worked on every female who crossed his path, Savannah had noticed-every one except Savannah.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While she could admit that he was a fine specimen of a man, she had less than no interest in getting tangled up with Quino Solis. He was as entrenched in Fairdale as the old maple trees on the town green. Which was saying something, since their trunks were the size of small cars, as they'd been there since the founding fathers had declared Fairdale a town and planted them in an attempt to tame this wild patch of earth in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. Joaquin was like those trees-the roots ran deep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He owned the Shadow Pine Stables on the outskirts of Fairdale, where he offered trail rides and riding lessons and worked with special-needs kids using equine therapy. He was never going to leave this town he loved, and Savannah had no intention of staying. Anything that happened between them was just flirting with heartbreak, most likely hers, and she'd had enough of that to last a lifetime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She was leaving Fairdale as soon as she got her old job in Manhattan back and no ridonkulously hot stable boy was going to change her career trajectory. She was 100 percent immune to him-okay, more like 95 percent. But she figured if she stayed out of his gravitational pull, she'd be fine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You don't know what you're missing," Maisy said under her breath. She tossed her short dark curls and turned away, but not before Savannah retorted, "Neither do you. You're marrying his best friend but that does not mean you are an expert on all things Quino."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't need to be," Maisy said. "He is legendary in Fairdale."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Savy rolled her eyes. Like she cared if Joaquin had dated every available woman in their quaint college town of seventy-five thousand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll take those, Quino," Maisy said. She scooped the Crock-Pot out of his hands and swept from the room, leaving Savannah and Joaquin alone. Subtle, Maisy was not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Savannah would have cursed her friend, but Maisy had been doing this for months, pushing the two of them together, clearly hoping to start a romance between them that would prevent Savy from returning to New York. Not gonna happen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An awkward silence filled the room. At least for Savannah it was awkward. Joaquin just shoved his hands in the back pockets of his jeans and studied her in a way that made her feel like he really saw her and that he liked what he saw. It was too much. He was too much.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She twisted her hair back up into its sloppy knot and he tipped his head to the side as he watched her. He seemed fascinated. It made Savy self-conscious, which never happened. Being taller than average with fiery red hair, freckles, and broad features, she was used to being overlooked as unfeminine, more handsome than pretty. She was fine with it as she liked getting by on her brains more than her looks, but Joaquin never overlooked her. She faced him, crossed her arms over her chest, and tried to stare him down. This was a mistake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He looked amused as he met her gaze. As if she was issuing him a challenge and he was eager to accept it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Quit looking at me like that," he said. The twinkle in his eye let her know he was teasing but she stepped in it anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Like what?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You know."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I assure you, I don't."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Like you want me to kiss you," he said. His gaze moved to her mouth and then back up to her eyes. It made her heart beat a little faster. She ignored it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What?" she scoffed. "Did you fall off your horse and hit your head? I do not want you to kiss me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No?" he asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was the picture of innocence. Meanwhile Savy could feel her face heat up, because in fact she had thought about him kissing her. Not right now, but the idea might have flashed through her mind once; okay, twice; all right, probably five or more times since she'd met him, but that was only because she hadn't been on a date in months and her hormones were wreaking havoc with her common sense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No." The word fired out of her like a bullet shot from a gun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Huh," he said. His gaze dropped back to her mouth. "My mistake."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll say it is." She tried to sound indignant but the attempt was shaky at best.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She marched stiffly past him, not giving him a chance to back up as she brushed by his muscle-hardened shoulder. A quick glance up and her gaze met his. His dark eyes were amused but they were also full of desire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It occurred to Savy that all she had to do was rise up on her toes, twine her arms about his neck, and kiss him and she could finally put to rest the curiosity she had about the feel of those full lips against hers. Would his kiss be soft or firm, gentle or rough? Would he hold her low and tight or high and loose? Would he bury his fingers in her hair while his mouth plundered hers, making it bruised from the impact of his kiss?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her thoughts must have been reflected upon her face, because the teasing glint left his eyes and he let out an unsteady breath. His voice when he spoke dropped an entire octave and was little more than a growl when he said, "You really need to stop looking at me like that."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Savy felt a pull in her lower belly as strongly as if he had hooked a finger in her waistband and was drawing her in close. From the overheated look in his eyes, she knew he'd most definitely been thinking about kissing her. The attraction between them had its own sizzle and zip and she knew if she gave in to it, she was going to get burned. She quickly stepped away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't know what you're talking about," she said. She made an exaggerated shrug. "I was just thinking about how badly my toilet needs a good scrubbing."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joaquin blinked at her and then he tipped his head back and laughed. Full lips parting over white teeth in a deep masculine chuckle that made her want to laugh in return. Whatever he'd been expecting that clearly wasn't it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Savy took some satisfaction there, but the grin he sent her was full of admiration with a nice dose of heat, making it nearly irresistible. She fought the urge to fan herself as she hurried to the kitchen to help Maisy with dinner, and maybe while there, she'd just crawl into the freezer until her body temperature went down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The countdown has begun," Ryder Copeland said as he handed Quino a beer. They were standing outside Ryder's half-restored Victorian house in the chilly midday air because Ryder thought deep-frying a fourteen-pound turkey was the coolest thing ever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What are you counting down?" Quino asked. "How long until Maisy kicks your butt for drying out her bird?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ha ha," Ryder said. He gestured to the bird that was sitting in a plastic tub on the wrought iron table beside them. "This poultry is going to be amazing. Just look at him."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"He looks like Deadweight Dougie," Quino said. "Same male-pattern baldness and beer gut."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ryder looked at the bird, then he picked it up under the wings and made it dance across the container. "He's got about the same sense of rhythm, too."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quino snorted. "Worst foreman ever."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And how," Ryder agreed. "I wonder what ever happened to that guy." He put the bird down with a pat on its rump.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ryder and Quino had become fast friends while working construction over a decade ago in Texas, under the dubious supervision of Deadweight Dougie, so named because he was usually drunk, and when he passed out he had to be rolled because he was deadweight and too heavy to pick up and carry. Dougie spent more time sleeping it off in the bed of his pickup truck than he did supervising his crew.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No idea, but I'd bet dollars to donuts he's snoring on someone's couch today." Quino glanced at the stone patio that was covered in a heavy tarp to catch all of the oil splatter. "So what are we counting down, the time until kickoff?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Nope. The ticktock is for you," Ryder said. "I'm calling you out. You said in July that Savannah would be your wife by Christmas, we are one month out, and unless I am misinformed, you haven't even had a date with her."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quino took a long pull on his beer. "Details."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yeah, kind of important details," Ryder said. He squinted at his friend. "She may be the first woman who has not succumbed to the Joaquin Solis magic."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quino lifted one eyebrow. He knew Ryder was teasing him, and he was cool with that, but his friend was also speaking the truth. Quino had never felt the sting of rejection from a woman before. Savannah was the first woman in memory who seemed indifferent to him. She was a challenge, which he had to admit made her sexy as hell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's how I know she's the one," he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Or <i>not </i>the one," Ryder countered. "You've been playing it pretty chill with her, keeping your distance, working the banter angle without being a pain in her ass."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Is that what she said?" Quino asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, that's what Maisy said she said."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I love having spies." Quino grinned. "So, what's the intel? Think she's ready for me to go full-court press in the charm-and-disarm department?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Not unless you want to be dropped by a sharp knee to your junk," Ryder said. "Last I heard, Savannah was still planning to move back to Manhattan by the end of the year. She wants her old life back. She's a city girl through and through, and living here in the Smoky Mountains is not her bag."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ryder checked the temperature on the oil in the deep fryer. Then he hefted up the naked bird and gently lowered it into the boiling oil. Quino felt for the bird. Whenever the subject of Savannah moving back to New York came up, he felt exactly like that, a dead bird hanging by a metal handle from his innards while being dipped in boiling oil. He clearly needed to step up his game. He pondered his options while the bird sizzled and Ryder talked about Maisy, football, and more Maisy. He came up with a whole lot of nothing.</p></p><h2>One Hundred English Folksongs (Dover Song Collections)</h2><p><p>English folk music collector Cecil J.

Pleased as I was about how I brought the characters and their adventures to life in the pages of the magazines, I still wanted the reader to know more about my people and why they did what they did. So, over the years, I revised and expanded these magazine works into fuller-length novels that I published in paperback under other titles.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;These particular early magazine versions of my books have long been a source of great speculation and curiosity among many of my readers, so much so of late, that I&#x2019;m now pleased to collect three of them in book form for the first time.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hope you enjoy them.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier. There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.THE TRAIL TO CRAZY MAN &nbsp;<br> CHAPTER I<br> &nbsp;<br> Shanghaied<br> &nbsp;<br> IN THE DANK, odorous forecastle, a big man with wide shoulders sat at a scarred mess table, his feet spread to brace himself against the roll of the ship. A brass hurricane lantern, its light turned low, swung from a beam overhead, and in the vague light the big man studied a worn and sweat-stained chart.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was no sound in the forecastle but the distant rustle of the bow wash about the hull, the lazy creak of the square-rigger&#x2019;s timbers, a few snores from sleeping men, and the hoarse, rasping breath of a man who was dying in the lower bunk.<br> &nbsp;<br> The big man who bent over the chart wore a slipover jersey with alternate red and white stripes, a broad leather belt and a brass buckle, and coarse jeans. On his feet were woven leather sandals of soft, much-oiled leather. His hair was shaggy and uncut, but he was clean-shaven except for a mustache and burnsides.<br> &nbsp;<br> The chart he studied showed the coast of northern California. He marked a point on it with the tip of his knife and then checked the time with a heavy gold watch. After a swift calculation, he folded the chart and replaced it in an oilskin packet with other papers and tucked the packet under his jersey, above his belt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rising, he stood for an instant, canting to the roll of the ship, staring down at the white-haired man in the lower bunk. There was that about the big man to make him stand out in any crowd. He was a man born to command, not only because of his splendid physique and the strength of his character, but because of his personality.<br> &nbsp;<br> He knelt beside the bunk and touched the dying man&#x2019;s wrist. The pulse was feeble. Rafe Caradec crouched there, waiting, watching, thinking.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a few hours at most, possibly even in a few minutes, this man would die. In the long year at sea his health had broken down under forced labor and constant beatings, and this last one had broken him up internally. When Charles Rodney was dead he, Rafe Caradec, would do what he must.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br> THE SHIP ROLLED slightly, and the older man sighed and his lids opened suddenly. For a moment he stared upward into the ill-smelling darkness. Then his head turned. He saw the big man crouched beside him, and he smiled. His hand fumbled for Rafe&#x2019;s.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve got the papers? You won&#x2019;t forget?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t forget.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You must be careful.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;See my wife, Carol. Explain to her that I didn&#x2019;t run away, that I wasn&#x2019;t afraid. Tell her I had the money and was comin&#x2019; back. I&#x2019;m worried about the mortgage I paid. I don&#x2019;t trust Barkow.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The man lay silent, breathing deeply, hoarsely. For the first time in three days he was conscious and aware.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Take care of &#x2019;em, Rafe,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to trust you! You&#x2019;re the only chance I have! Dyin&#x2019; ain&#x2019;t bad, except for them. And to think&#x2014;a whole year has gone by. Anything may have happened!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better rest,&#x201d; Rafe said gently.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s late for that. He&#x2019;s done me in this time. Why did this happen to me, Rafe? To us?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Caradec shrugged his powerful shoulders. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. No reason, I guess. We were just there at the wrong time. We took a drink we shouldn&#x2019;t have taken.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The old man&#x2019;s voice lowered. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re goin&#x2019; to try&#x2014;tonight?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rafe smiled then. &#x201c;Try? Tonight we&#x2019;re goin&#x2019; ashore, Rodney. This is our only chance. I&#x2019;m goin&#x2019; to see the captain first.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rodney smiled and lay back, his face a shade whiter, his breathing more gentle.<br> &nbsp;<br> A year they had been together, a brutal, ugly, awful year of labor, blood, and bitterness. It had begun, that year, one night in San Francisco in Hongkong Bohl&#x2019;s place on the Barbary Coast. Rafe Caradec was just back from Central America with a pocketful of money. His latest revolution was cleaned up, and the proceeds were mostly in his pocket, with some in the bank.<br> &nbsp;<br> The months just past had been jungle months, dripping jungle, fever ridden and stifling with heat and humidity. It had been a period of raids and battles, but finally it was over, and Rafe had taken his payment in cash and moved on. He had been on the town, making up for lost time&#x2014;Rafe Caradec, gambler, soldier of fortune, wanderer of the far places.<br> &nbsp;<br> Somewhere along the route that night he had met Charles Rodney, a sun-browned cattleman who had come to Frisco to raise money for his ranch in Wyoming. They had had a couple of drinks and dropped in at Hongkong Bohl&#x2019;s dive. They&#x2019;d had a drink there, too, and when they awakened it had been to the slow, long roll of the sea, and the brutal voice of Bully Borger, skipper of the Mary S.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rafe had cursed himself for a tenderfoot and a fool. To have been shanghaied like any drunken farmer! He had shrugged it off, knowing the uselessness of resistance. After all, it was not his first trip to sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rodney had been wild. He had rushed to the captain and demanded to be put ashore, and Bully Borger had knocked him down and booted him senseless while the mate stood by with a pistol. That had happened twice more, until Rodney returned to work almost a cripple and frantic with worry over his wife and daughter.<br> &nbsp;<br> As always, the crew had split into cliques. One of these consisted of Rafe, Rodney, Roy Penn, Rock Mullaney and Tex Brisco. Penn had been a law student and occasional prospector. Mullaney was an able-bodied seaman, hard-rock miner, and cowhand. They had been shanghaied in Frisco in the same lot with Rafe and Rodney. Tex Brisco was a Texas cowhand who had been shanghaied from a waterfront dive in Galveston, where he had gone to look at the sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finding a friend in Rafe, Rodney had told him the whole story of his coming to Wyoming with his wife and daughter, of what drouth and Indians had done to his herd, and how finally he had mortgaged his ranch to a man named Barkow.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rustlers had invaded the country, and he had lost cattle. Finally reaching the end of his rope he had gone to San Francisco to get a loan from an old friend. In San Francisco, surprisingly, he had met Barkow and some others, and paid off the mortgage. A few hours later, wandering into Hongkong Bohl&#x2019;s place, which had been recommended to him by Barkow&#x2019;s friends, he had been doped, robbed, and shanghaied.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br> WHEN THE SHIP returned to Frisco after a year, Rodney had demanded to be put ashore, and Borger had laughed at him. Then Charles Rodney had tackled the big man again, and that time the beating had been final. With Rodney dying, the Mary S. had finished her loading and slipped out of port so he could be conveniently &#x201c;lost at sea.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The cattleman&#x2019;s breathing had grown gentler, and Rafe leaned his head on the edge of the bunk, dozing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rodney had given him a deed to the ranch, a deed that gave him a half share, the other half belonging to Rodney&#x2019;s wife and daughter. Caradec had promised to save the ranch if he possibly could. Rodney had also given him Barkow&#x2019;s signed receipt for the money.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rafe&#x2019;s head came up with a jerk. How long he had slept he did not know, yet....He stiffened as he glanced at Charles Rodney. The hoarse, rasping breath was gone; the even, gentle breath was no more. Rodney was dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> For an instant, Rafe held the old man&#x2019;s wrist. Then he drew the blanket over Rodney&#x2019;s face. Abruptly, then, he got up. A quick glance at his watch told him they had only a few minutes until they would sight Cape Mendocino. Grabbing a small bag of things off the upper bunk, he turned quickly to the companionway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two big feet and two hairy ankles were visible on the top step. They moved, and step by step a man came down the ladder. He was a big man, bigger than Rafe, and his small, cruel eyes stared at him and then at Rodney&#x2019;s bunk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dead?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The big man rubbed a fist along his unshaven jowl. He grinned at Rafe.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I heard him speak about the ranch. It could be a nice thing, that. I heard about them ranches. Money in &#x2019;em.&#x201d; His eyes brightened with cupidity and cunning. &#x201c;We share an&#x2019; share alike, eh?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d; Caradec&#x2019;s voice was flat. &#x201c;The deed is made out to his daughter and me. His wife is to share, also. I aim to keep nothin&#x2019; for myself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The big man chuckled hoarsely. &#x201c;I can see that!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Josh Briggs is no fool, Caradec! You&#x2019;re intendin&#x2019; to get it all for yourself. I want mine!&#x201d; He leaned on the handrail of the ladder. &#x201c;We can have a nice thing, Caradec. They said there was trouble over there? Huh! I guess we can handle any trouble, an&#x2019; make some ourselves.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Rodneys get it all,&#x201d; Rafe said. &#x201c;Stand aside. I&#x2019;m in a hurry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Briggs&#x2019;s face was ugly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get high an&#x2019; mighty with me!&#x201d; he said roughly. &#x201c;Unless you split even with me, you don&#x2019;t get away. I know about the boat you&#x2019;ve got ready. I can stop you there, or here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rafe Caradec knew the futility of words. There are some natures to whom only violence is an argument. His left hand shot up suddenly, his stiffened fingers and thumb making a V that caught Briggs where his jawbone joined his throat.<br> &nbsp;<br> The blow was short, vicious, unexpected. Briggs&#x2019;s head jerked back, and Rafe hooked short and hard with his right, following through with a smashing elbow that flattened Briggs&#x2019;s nose and showered him with blood.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rafe dropped his bag and then struck, left and right to the body, then left and right to the chin. The last two blows cracked like pistol shots. Josh Briggs hit the foot of the ladder in a heap, rolled over, and lay still, his head partly under the table. Rafe picked up his bag and went up the ladder without so much as a backward glance.</p><h2>The Oregon Trail (Economy Editions)</h2><p>Keen observations and a graphic style characterize the author&#39;s remarkable record of a vanishing frontier.

In these lean times, it is enough to warrant a fire in my chamber, a small blaze to warm my bones as I scratch out these lines in the gray light of a chill November day. My daughter-in-law Marie, who governs this household, is mean with firewood. The manor is mine, and there would be a decent, if not lavish living to be had for us on these lands if there were a young man or two to work them. But since my son Rob died last year of the bloody flux, a kind of weariness has settled upon me, robbing me of purpose. Though I am still hale and strong, thank the Lord, each morning it is a struggle to rise from my bed and begin the daily tasks. And since Rob&#x2019;s death, Marie has become bitter, silent and thrifty. So, she has decreed, no chamber fires in daylight, unless it rains; meat but once a week; and daily prayers for his soul, morning and night. In my melancholy state, I cannot find the will to oppose her.</p><p>On Sundays, Marie doesn&#x2019;t speak at all, just sits praying and contemplating the sufferings of Our Lord in the big, cold hall all day and then I rouse myself and take my grandson, my namesake Alan, out to the woods on the far edge of my land where he plays at being an outlaw and I sit and sing to him and tell him the stories of my youth: of my own carefree days outside the law, when I feared no King&#x2019;s man, no sheriff nor forester, when I did as I pleased, took what I wanted, and followed the rule of none but my outlaw master: Robert Odo, the Lord of Sherwood.</p><p>I feel the cold now, at nearly threescore years, more than I ever did as that young man, and the damp; and now my old wounds ache for most of the winter. As I watch the gray rain drifting down on to my fruit trees, I clutch my fur-lined robe tighter against the chill air and my left hand drifts up the sleeve, over the corded swordsman&#x2019;s muscles, and finds its way to a long, deep scar high on my right forearm. And stroking the tough, smooth furrow, I remember the terrible battle where I earned that mark.</p><p>I was on my back in a morass of blood and churned earth, half-blinded by sweat and my helmet, which had been knocked forward, my sword held pointing up at the sky in a hopeless gesture of defense as I gasped breathless on the ground. Above me, the huge, gray-mailed swordsman was slashing at my right arm. Time slowed to a crawl, I could see the slow sweep of his blade, I could see the bitter rage on his face, I could feel the bite of the metal through the padding of my sleeve into the flesh of my right arm, and then, out of nowhere, came Robin&#x2019;s blocking sword-stroke, almost too late, but stopping the blade from slicing too deeply.</p><p>And, later, I recall Robin bandaging the wound himself, sweat-grimed, his own wounded face bleeding, and grinning at me as I winced in pain. He said, and I will remember his words until my death: &#x201c;It seems that God really wants this hand, Alan. But I have denied it to him three times&#x2014;and He shall never take it while I have strength.&#x201d;</p><p>It was my right hand, my quill hand that he saved, and with this hand I plan to repay my debt to him. With this instrument, the Lord willing, I will write his story, and my story, and set before the world the truth about the vicious outlaw and master thief, the murderer, the mutilator and tender lover, the victorious Earl and commander of an army, and, ultimately, the great magnate who brought a King of England to a table at Runnymede and made him submit to the will of the people of the land; the story of a man I knew simply as Robin Hood.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Everyone in our village knew Robin was coming. Since the lord of the manor&#x2019;s death last winter, the village had an almost perpetual holiday atmosphere: there was no authority to force them to work on the lord&#x2019;s demesne and, after tending their own strips of land, the villagers had time on their hands. The alewife&#x2019;s house was full all day and buzzing with talk of Robin&#x2019;s exploits, adventures and atrocities. But very little truth was spoken and news was scant: merely that he would be arriving at dusk and he would see anyone who had business with him at the church that night, where he would hold his court.</p><p>I was above all this noise and nuisance, quite literally, as I was hiding in the hayloft above the stable at the back of my mother&#x2019;s crumbling cottage in a den I&#x2019;d built in the hay. I was thirteen summers old, I had a throbbing knot the size of a walnut on my forehead, a bloody nose, a bad cut on my cheek, and I was treating the terror that I felt with a large dose of absolute boredom. I&#x2019;d been there since midafternoon when I had stumbled into our home, breathless, cut and bruised, having escaped the rough hands of the law and run the dozen miles from Nottingham across the fields all the way home.</p><p>We were poor, almost destitute and, after seeing my mother weeping with exhaustion one too many times after a day scratching a meager living gathering and selling firewood to her neighbors, I had decided to become a thief, more precisely a cutpurse: I cut the leather straps that secured men&#x2019;s purses to their belts with a small knife that I kept as keen as a razor. Nine times out of ten, they never noticed until I was twenty yards away and lost in the thick crowds of Nottingham&#x2019;s market place. When I returned home with a handful of silver pennies and placed them before my mother, she never asked where they had come from, but smiled and kissed me and hurried out to buy food. Though it had been necessity that drove me to take my daily bread from others, I found, God forgive me, that I was good at it, and liked it. In fact, I loved the thrill of the hunt; following a fat merchant as he waded through the market-day crowds, silent as his shadow, then the rough jostle, as if by accident, a quick slice and away before the man knew his purse was gone.</p><p>That day, however, I&#x2019;d been stupid and I&#x2019;d tried to steal a pie&#x2014;a rich, golden-crusted beef pie, as big as my two fists&#x2014;from a stall. I was hungry, as always, but overconfident too.</p><p>It was a ruse I had used before: I stood behind a blowsy alewife who was poking the wares on the stall and grumbling about their price; surreptitiously lobbed a small stone at the next stallholder along&#x2014;a cheesemonger, if I remember rightly&#x2014;hitting him full on the ear; and in the ensuing recriminations between stallholders, I swept the pie off the board and into my open satchel and sauntered away.</p><p>But the pieman&#x2019;s apprentice, who&#x2019;d been taking a piss behind their cart, came out just as I was scooping up my dinner and shouted: &#x201c;Hi!&#x201d; And everybody turned. So then it was &#x201c;Stop thief!&#x201d; and &#x201c;Catch him, somebody!&#x201d; as I squirmed like a maddened eel through the press of townsfolk until&#x2014;crack!&#x2014;I was knocked down by a cudgel to the forehead from some yokel and then grabbed &#x2019;round the neck by a passing man-at-arms. He punched me twice full in the face with his great mailed fist and my legs went limp.</p><p>When I came &#x2019;round, moments later, I was lying on the ground at the center of a jabbering crowd. Standing over me was the soldier, who wore the black surcoat with red chevrons of Sir Ralph Murdac, by the wrath of God, High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests. And suddenly I was seized rigid with terror.</p><p>The soldier hauled me to my feet by my hair and I stood dazed and trembling while the scarlet-faced apprentice yammered out the tale of the stolen pie. My satchel was torn open and the circle of onlookers craned to see the incriminating object steaming gently, deliciously, at my waist. I still get jets of saliva in my mouth when I remember its glorious aroma.</p><p>Then, a wave of jostling and shouting, and the crowd parted, swept aside by the spears of a dozen men-at-arms, and into the space stepped a nobleman, dressed entirely in black, who seemed to move in his own personal circle of awe.</p><p>Though I had never seen him before, I knew immediately that this was Sir Ralph Murdac himself: the magnate who held Nottingham castle for the King and who also held the power of life and death over all the people in a huge swathe of central England. The crowd fell silent and I gawped at him, terrified, as he gazed calmly up and down my thin body, taking in my dirty blond hair, muddy face and ragged clothes. He was a slight man, not tall but handsome, with an athletic body clad in black silk tunic and hose, and a pitch-dark cloak, fixed with a golden clasp at his throat. In his right hand he held a riding whip; a yard-long black leather-covered rod tapering from an inch thick at the butt to the width of a bootlace. At his left side hung a silver-handled sword in a black leather scabbard. His face was clean-shaven, finely carved and framed with pure black hair, cut and curled neatly into a bowl shape. I caught a whiff of his perfume: lavender, and something musky. The palest blue eyes I had ever seen, cold and inhuman, seemed to glitter like frost beneath dark eyebrows. He pursed his red lips as he considered me. And suddenly all my fear receded, like a wave pulling back from the shingle of the beach&nbsp;... and I discovered that I hated him. I was filled with a cold stony loathing: I hated what he and his kind had done to me and my family. I hated his wealth, I hated his expensive clothes, his good looks, his perfumed perfection, and the arrogance that he was born to. I hated his power over me, his assumption of superiority, the truth of his superiority. I focused my hate in my stare. And I think he must have recognized my animosity. For an instant our eyes locked and then, with a jerk of his perfectly square chin, he looked away. At that moment, I sneezed, a colossal nasal bark so loud and sudden that it shocked everyone. Sir Ralph started, and glared at me in astonishment. I could feel snot and blood mingling in my battered nose. It began to run down the side of my mouth and on to my chin. I resisted the urge to lick at it. Murdac was silent, staring at me with utter contempt. Then he spoke very quietly: &#x201c;Take this&nbsp;... filth&nbsp;... to the castle,&#x201d; he said in English, but in a lisping French-accented whisper. And then, almost as an afterthought, he said directly to me: &#x201c;Tomorrow, you disgusting fellow, we shall slice off that thieving hand.&#x201d;</p><p>I sneezed again and a plump gobbet of bloody phlegm shot out and splattered on to his immaculate black cloak. He looked down in horror at the red-yellow mess, then, quick as a striking adder, he lashed me full in the face with his riding whip. The blow knocked me to my knees, and blood started to pour from a two-inch cut on my cheek. Through eyes misty with rage and pain, I looked up at Sir Ralph Murdac. He stared back at me for a second, his blue eyes strangely blank, then he dropped the riding whip in the mud, as if it had been contaminated with plague, turned smoothly away, hitched his cloak to a more comfortable position and swept through the surrounding rabble of townsfolk, who parted before him like the Red Sea before Moses.</p><p>As the man-at-arms started to drag me away by my wrist, I heard a woman cry: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Alan, the widow Dale&#x2019;s son. Have pity on him, he&#x2019;s only a fatherless boy!&#x201d; And the man paused, turning to speak to her, with my arm gripped in only one of his fists. And, as he turned, I focused my hatred, my anger, and I twisted my wrist against his grip, ripped it free, squirmed through a pair of legs and took to my heels. A fury of bellowing erupted behind me: men-at-arms shoving and cursing the people obstructing their path. I jinked right and left, sliding through the crowd, shoving past stout yeomen, dodging around the goodwives and their baskets. I created a tornado of confusion as the people reacted angrily to my passing. Men and women turned fast, furious at being shoved so roughly. Carts were knocked flying; pottery crashed to the ground; the hurdles containing a herd of sheep were smashed and the animals let loose to add their bleating to the tumult; and I was away and racing down a side alley, bursting through a blacksmith&#x2019;s forge and out the other side, up a narrow street, squeezing between two big town houses, and turning left down another street until the noise subsided behind me. I stopped in the doorway of a church by the town wall and recovered my wind. There appeared to be no pursuit. Then, fighting to calm my hammering heart, I walked as coolly as I could, my hood pulled forward, a hand held casually over my cut and bruised face, out of the town gate, past the dozing watchman, and on to the winding road that led into the thick woodland. Once out of sight, I ran. I ran like the wind, despite my pounding head, and a sick feeling churning my guts. I gave it my all till our village came into sight around a bend in the road. As I paused to catch my breath, I found I was clutching my right wrist tightly. I still had my arm, praise God, I still had my light fingers. I still had the pie, too.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>As I lay in the hayloft, nursing my cut and bruised face, I ran images of the day again in my head. There had been no pursuit on the road out of Nottingham, as far as I could tell, but the woman in the market had known me and so it wouldn&#x2019;t be long, I realized&#x2014;probably the next morning&#x2014;before the sheriff&#x2019;s men came for me at my mother&#x2019;s cottage.</p><p>So that night, my mother took me to see Robin.</p><p>The village was dark, except for a ring of torches around the old church at the northern end of the village. Our church was not grand&#x2014;it was not much bigger than a village house, but built of thick stone with a thatched roof. We had no priest as the village was too poor to support his living&#x2014;it was scarcely more than a hamlet, truth be told. But on holy festivals, Easter, Michaelmas, Christmas and the like, a junior cleric would come from Nottingham and hold a Mass. And, sure as man is born to die, after the harvest, the Bishop&#x2019;s man would come to collect our tithes.</p><p>As it was the largest, most solid building in the village, we also used it for meetings and, in the recent Anarchy between King Stephen and the Empress Maud, it had sheltered the villagers from roving bands of warriors intent on slaughter and pillage. In those dark days, a wise man, the saying went, kept his coin buried, his dress plain and his daughters inside.</p><p>Since King Henry came to the throne, thirty-four years ago, England had known a kind of peace. We no longer had to contend with marauding bands of rebel soldiers, but we did have to bow our heads to Sir Ralph Murdac&#x2019;s men-at-arms. And they could be just as rapacious, especially now that the King was abroad, fighting against his son Duke Richard of Aquitaine and Philip Augustus, the King of France. Our Henry had appointed Ranulf de Glanville to rule as Justiciar and England, many a villager muttered, was no longer well governed. Ranulf, it was said, loved silver and gold and would appoint anyone&#x2014;even the Devil himself&#x2014;to the post of sheriff if he could pay, and continue paying handsomely for the office. He had been a sheriff himself and he knew exactly how much tax silver could be squeezed from a county. And so we were squeezed until the pips squeaked. Certainly Ralph Murdac, who had been appointed by Glanville, was said to be making a goodly fortune for the Justiciar, and for himself.</p></p><h2>Access to Health</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in personal health.</i> </p> <p> <br> </p> <p> <b>Motivate students to become actively engaged in their own health</b> </p> <p> <i> <b>Access to Health&nbsp;</b> </i>combines scientifically valid research and the most current information to encourage healthy life choices.

In that role, she has chaired the department and been program coordinator for the Health Promotion and Health Behavior Program (bachelor&#x2019;s degree, master of public health, and PhD degree programs), as well as served on over 50 national, state, regional, and university committees focused on improving student academic success and improving the public&#x2019;s health. Most importantly to her, she has also taught and mentored thousands of undergraduate and graduate students. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Donatelle has a PhD in community health/health promotion and health education, with specializations in health behaviors, aging, and chronic disease prevention, from the University of Oregon; a master of science degree in health education from the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse; and a bachelor of science degree from the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse, with majors in health/physical education and English. In recent years, Donatelle has received several professional awards for leadership, teaching, and service within the university and for her work on developing nationally ranked undergraduate and graduate programs in the health promotion/health behavior areas.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Her primary research and scholarship areas have focused on finding scientifically appropriate means of motivating behavior change among resistant populations. Specifically, her work uses incentives, social and community supports, and risk communication strategies in motivating diverse populations to change their risk behaviors. She has worked with pregnant women who smoke in an effort to motivate them to quit smoking, obese women of all ages who are at risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, prediabetic women at risk for progression to type 2 diabetes, and a wide range of other health issues and problems. Earlier research projects have focused on decision making and factors influencing the use of alternative and traditional health care providers for treatment of low back pain, illness and sick role behaviors, occupational stress and stress claims, and worksite health promotion. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>More recently, through her writing she has been working to provide scientifically defensible, engaging ways to help students understand today's complex health and health care challenges, to ask the tough questions, understand that there are often no simple solutions to the myriad of issues we face both in the US and internationally. With this text in particular, she has worked to motivate students to approach their challenges in a mindful, thoughtful way; to take time to notice and to look within and outside themselves in order to really see, hear and feel the life experience to act compassionately toward self and toward others who are struggling with personal challenges. Importantly, she challenges students to ask..."<i>How can I make the world a better place, for me.. for others, and for future generations?</i>...to live more healthfully, and with more enthusiasm?" Whether it be working to improve personal health behaviors, help others who are struggling, or working to improve the social, political, and macro health environment, her goal is to motivate students to become more engaged and be the health change agents of the future.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to her 'writing', Dr. Donatelle enjoys playing acoustic guitar, gardening, camping and socializing with friends and family, and walks with her three rambunctious Westies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Feeding the Crisis (California Studies in Food and Culture) (Volume 71)</h2><p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, is one of the most controversial forms of social welfare in the United States. Although it&#x2019;s commonly believed that such federal programs have been cut back since the 1980s, Maggie Dickinson charts the dramatic expansion and reformulation of the food safety net in the twenty-first century. Today, receiving SNAP benefits is often tied to work requirements, which&nbsp;essentially subsidizes&nbsp;low-wage jobs. Excluded populations&#x2014;such as&nbsp;the unemployed, informally employed workers, and&nbsp;undocumented immigrants&#x2014;must rely on charity to survive.<br><br><i>Feeding the Crisis</i>&nbsp;tells the story of eight families as they navigate the terrain of an expanding network of assistance programs in which care and abandonment work hand in hand to make access to food uncertain for people on the social and economic margins. Amid calls at the federal level to expand work&nbsp;requirements for food assistance, Dickinson shows us how such ideas are bad policy that fail to adequately address hunger in America.&nbsp;<i>Feeding the Crisis</i>&nbsp;brings the voices of food-insecure families into national debates about welfare policy, offering fresh insights into how we can establish a right to food in the United States.</p><p>"Maggie Dickinson has written a wonderful book that grasps the essential features of our restructured social policies and provides a ground-level view of what the new workfare policies mean in the lives of the many people enmeshed in them."&amp;;&amp;;Frances Fox Piven,&nbsp;author of&nbsp;<i>Challenging Authority </i>and&nbsp;coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Regulating the Poor </i>and&nbsp;<i>Poor People's Movements</i><br><br> "More than two decades after the publication of Janet Poppendieck&amp;;s groundbreaking&nbsp;<i>Sweet Charity?</i>, Dickinson updates and brings additional complexity to an analysis of the impoverished state of the American food safety net. The ethnographic moments are engaging and moving; the arguments smart and nuanced. <i>Feeding the Crisis</i> is a highly teachable book!"&amp;;&amp;;Julie Guthman, author of&nbsp;<i>Weighing In: Obesity, Food Justice, and the Limits of Capitalism</i><br><br> "This is an incredibly important book. It not only offers a study of food assistance programs in the wake of both the 1996 welfare reform and 2008 financial crisis, but also ties its primary concern with hunger to thinking about the nature of formal and informal work, broader changes in the economy, and the gendering of paid and care work."&amp;;&amp;;Alison Hope Alkon, author of&nbsp;<i>Black, White, and Green: Farmer Markets, Race, and the Green Economy</i><b>Maggie Dickinson</b>&nbsp;is Assistant Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies at the City University of&nbsp;New York&#x2019;s Guttman Community College.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Corrections (Justice Series) (The Justice Series)</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in Introduction to Corrections and Corrections Theory and Policy</i> </p> <p> <b> <br> </b> </p> <p> <b>Brief.

Continuing to emphasize a comparative approach, the text explores the endocrine mechanisms that have evolved in both human and nonhuman animals to solve common problems in survival and reproduction. The fifth edition benefits by the addition of a new coauthor, Lance Kriegsfeld (<em>The University of California, Berkeley</em>), who brings additional expertise and teaching experience in behavioral endocrinology.<br><br>The text describes interactions among hormones, brain, and behavior from a historical perspective, emphasizing connections among key theories and tracing the emergence of important hypotheses. The book is organized around the conceptual theme that hormones affect behavior by influencing one or more of three "components" of behaving animals--input mechanisms (such as sensory or perceptual processes), the central processing mechanisms of the nervous system (either directly, or by affecting its development or structure), and output mechanisms (such as effectors or peripheral structures). Despite increased coverage of molecular and cellular approaches, the book strives for accessibility for non-biological science students.<br><br><em>An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology</em>, Fifth Edition, is appropriate for upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in psychology, biology, anthropology, or zoology.

The first generation of its historians had access to a limited range of sources, and they focused primarily on military events. More recent approaches have embraced cultural, diplomatic, economic, and social history. In this authoritative and readable history, Hew Strachan combines these perspectives with a military and strategic narrative. The result is an account that breaks the bounds of national preoccupations to become both global and comparative.<br> The first of three volumes in this magisterial study, <em>To Arms</em> examines not only the causes of the war and its opening clashes on land and sea, but also the ideas that underpinned it, and the motivations of the people who supported it. It provides pioneering accounts of the war's finances, the war in Africa, and the Central Powers' bid to widen the war outside Europe.<br></p><p><br><strong>Hew Strachan</strong> is Professor of Modern History at the University of Glasgow. He is also Director of the Scottish Center for War Studies and Life Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.<br><br>"Deserves to rank as one of the most impressive books of modern history in a generation. It reflects 20 years of research, and mastery of the literature of many nations....The book addresses every aspect of global conflict--diplomacy, politics, finance, industry, battle on land and at sea, in Europe, Africa, and around the world.....Magnificent."--<em>The London Evening Standard</em><p></p><br>"'Definitive' is a much overused word, but this work merits the term. The first in a three-volume history that explores nearly every aspect of the war, from finance to ideology to diplomacy to armaments, it combines depth with staggering breadth, acute analysis with magisterial narrative."--<em>The</em> <em>Atlantic Monthly</em><p></p><br>"'Definitive', proclaims the blurb accompanying the first volume of Hew Strachan's magnificent new history of the first world war, and definitive it is. There will be two further volumes...The result will be a scholarly triumph.

These professionals must perceive the needs of people with cultural patterns which are different from the &#34;standard and dominant&#34; patterns in the United States and Canada. Accordingly, the book includes illustrative episodes and in-depth presentations of selected &#34;ethnic patterns&#34;. Each of the &#34;ethnic chapters&#34; is written by an author who shares the cultural traditions the chapter describes. Other chapters examine multicultural issues and provide the means for personal reflection on death and dying. There are also two bibliographic sections, one general and one geared towards children. The text is divided into three sections - Cross-Cultural and Personal perspectives, Dying, Death, and Grief Among Selected Ethnic Communities, and Reflections and Conclusions. The book is aimed at those in the fields of clinical psychology, grief therapy, sociology, nursing, social and health care work.</p><p>"The strength of the book is that contributors write about their own traditions rather than reporting on studies about traditions... the reader gains a respect for the varied ways racial, ethnic, and cultural groups have learned to try to make sense of death."<br>-MADDVOCATE <br></p><h2>Diversity, Oppression, and Social Functioning: Person-In-Environment Assessment and Intervention</h2><p><p> <b>Using the &#x201c;Person-In-Environment&#x201d; (PIE) theoretical framework, this diversity practice text teaches students how to think about their personal reactions and assumptions about diversity and what constitutes cultural competent &#x201c;assessment&#x201d; and &#x201c;intervention&#x201d; when working with a broad range of diverse populations.</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The diverse populations presented in the text are described within an ecological, strengths perspective.

His vivid descriptions inspired the best work of other artists who lived nearby, including such noted photographers as Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, and their younger contemporary Morley Baer. Before he died in 1995, Baer was planning a volume that would bring together a group of his landscape photographs of the Big Sur area with a selection of poems that expressed Jeffers's mystical experience of stone. Jeffers believed that stone is alive, perhaps even conscious in some way. Baer wanted to create a visual and literary meditation on the life-experience of stone. James Karman was invited by Baer to serve as his collaborator, and has brought the project to completion&#x2015;more than 50 of Baer's photographs paired with poems by Jeffers (some complete, others excerpted). <i>Stones of the Sur</i> is in five parts, each of which takes its title from a poem. Part I, "Tor House," contains photographs and poems about Jeffers's home, ever the locus of his inspiration. Part II, "Continent's End," begins with a panoramic view of the coastline and is followed by visual and textual images that become progressively narrower in scope as Baer and Jeffers focus on the mountains, cliffs, beaches, boulders, rocks, and pebbles of the Big Sur. The inward progression continues in Part III, "Oh Lovely Rock," where Baer trains his lens on close surfaces&#x2015;revealing his sensibilities at their most abstract. From the middle of Part III on, the spiral is reversed and the view begins to open. Part IV, "Credo," expands outwardly from the pebbles and rocks of the Big Sur back to the beaches, cliffs, and mountains. Part V, "The Old Stone-Mason," concludes the book with a return to Tor House.</p><p>&#x201c;An elegant coda to the remarkable series, with more than 50 stunning photographs.&#x201d;&#x2014;San Francisco Chronicle<br>"A master in his field. . . .

Each selection is preceded by an introduction that identifies the author and provides information that allows modern readers to consider these texts in a new light. What we discover might be surprising. For instance, in Cicero's orations and Marcus Aurelius' meditations, we hear echoes of today's political forums and popular-psychology talk-show hosts. Virgil's ironic dramatization of the founding myth in the <em>Aeneid</em> prepared the way for America's deeply embedded ambivalence toward the presidency. The Roman preference for practicality over philosophy, leading to a network of superhighways that joined Europe, Asia, Asia Minor, and Africa, literally paved the way for the "global village" of the contemporary world.<br><br>From Plautus' wildly comic plays to Cato's instructions on farming, and from Catullus' erotic poems to Petronius' descriptions of the decadent splendor of the declining empire, <em>The Classical Roman Reader</em> provides access to the literary, artistic, social, religious, political, scientific, and philosophical texts that shaped Roman thinking and helped form the backbone of Western culture.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kenneth J.

A masterpiece of technical exposition, it was the basic textbook of astronomy for more than a thousand years, and still is the main source for our knowledge of ancient astronomy. This translation, based on the standard Greek text of Heiberg, makes the work accessible to English readers in an intelligible and reliable form. It contains numerous corrections derived from medieval Arabic translations and extensive footnotes that take account of the great progress in understanding the work made in this century, due to the discovery of Babylonian records and other researches. It is designed to stand by itself as an interpretation of the original, but it will also be useful as an aid to reading the Greek text.</p></p><p><p>"Whatever we now understand of Ptolemy ... is in this book."<b>--Noel Swerdlow, University of Chicago</b></p><b>G.J.

Nevertheless, in none of these cases has the concept been examined from the perspective of community's original etymological meaning: <i>cum munus</i>. In <i>Communitas: The Origin and Destiny of Community</i>, Roberto Esposito does just that through an original counter-history of political philosophy that takes up not only readings of community by Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, Heidegger and Bataille, but also by H�lderlin, Nietzsche, Canetti, Arendt, and Sartre. The result of his extraordinary conceptual and lexical analysis is a radical overturning of contemporary interpretations of community. Community isn't a property, nor is it a territory to be separated and defended against those who do not belong to it. Rather, it is a void, a debt, a gift to the other that also reminds us of our constitutive alterity with respect to ourselves.</p><p>Roberto Esposito teaches contemporary philosophy at the Italian Institute for the Human Sciences in Naples. His <i>B�os: Biopolitics and Philosophy</i> (2008) has also been translated into English."Esposito is an expansive thinker, unusually attuned to the historical as well as the philosophical dimensions of that hybrid field called 'political theory.' After a wondrous excursus on the problematic of 'community,' Esposito's challenging elaboration of community as alterity unfolds. This important and attractive translation brings to political theorists working in English Esposito's skill at speaking across the division between the analytic continental traditions." (Kirstie McClure, University of California)<br><br>"Those&#x2015;especially English-speaking readers&#x2015;familiar with Esposito's later research (and, in particular with <i>Bios</i>, Esposito [2008]) will find this work particularly valuable for laying out the ontological ground upon which his account of immunity and biopolitics was subsequently worked out." (Andrea Rossi)<br><br>"With <i>Communitas</i>, Esposito has made an enormous contribution to the cardinal and complex notion of community, taking issue with the essentializing view of community that remains inherent in the language of contemporary philosophy. The reader feels guided through debates of great complexity by a generous expert who knows not only the major arguments, but the minor caveats and inconsistencies as well." &#x2015;Peter Connor, Columbia University<br><br>"Underlying [Esposito's] philosophical work is the idea that our political vocabulary is exhausted. Old political notions need not to be replaced by new ones, but through historical reflection it is important to trace what has remained unthought in those concepts . . . Esposito's reflections are most stimulating." (Walter Van Herck <i><i>Bijdragen, International Journal in Philosophy and Theology</i></i>)<br><br>"With his usual erudition and philosophical precision, Roberto Esposito traces the development of the concept of community and its limits through the European tradition. His argument poses a challenge for anyone who wants to think community today."

However over the past decade there has been a rising movement to accurately describe Native cultures and histories. In particular, people have begun to explore the experience of urban Indians&#x2014;individuals who live in two worlds struggling to preserve traditional Native values within the context of an ever-changing modern society. In Genocide of the Mind, the experience and determination of these people is recorded in a revealing and compelling collection of essays that brings the Native American experience into the twenty-first century. Contributors include: Paula Gunn Allen, Simon Ortiz, Sherman Alexie, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Maurice Kenny, as well as emerging writers from different Indian nations.</p><p>Addressing the genocide of Native American cultural identity over the past 100 years, this collection of 35 essays by authors representing more than 25 tribal nations is at once eye-opening, brutally frank, and ultimately optimistic. Established writers such as Paula Gunn Allen, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Maurice Kenny, along with a host of emerging writers, teachers, poets, students, and visual artists, have come together, brilliantly elucidating the overlapping causes of the disappearance of tribal identity. These include the move by 60 percent of Native Americans to urban areas, the dissipation of Native languages, gradual assimilation into the non-Native society and the resulting mixed parentage of many young Native Americans, and media stereotyping and its concomitant racism. Every reader will feel a call to action after finishing this informative volume, whether he or she is a non-Native who realizes the need for the banning of Indian sports mascots or a Native moved to dedicate more time to passing on tribal language and tradition to the next generation. <i>Deborah Donovan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Every week she would look forward to the one day she could call her own, and would plan to visit people she wanted to see as a welcome respite from the routine duties that being a vicar&#39;s wife entailed. But one Thursday in June was to be more special than any other. It was the day that Dorothea Cassidy was strangled. As the small town of Otterbridge prepares for its summer carnival, Inspector Stephen Ramsay begins a painstaking reconstruction of Dorothea&#39;s last hours. He soon discovers that she had taken on a number of deserving cases - a sick and lonely old woman, a disturbed adolescent, a compulsive gambler, a single mother with a violent boyfriend and a child in care - and even her close family have their secrets to hide. All these people are daunted, in one way or another, by Dorothea&#39;s goodness. But which of them could have possibly wanted her dead? It is not until a second body is discovered that Ramsay starts to understand how Dorothea lived - and why she died.

Reprint.</p><p>Science fiction icon David Weber (the Honor Harrington series) teams up with Airborne-soldier-turned-author John Ringo (<i>A Hymn Before Battle</i>) in their third novel about Prince Roger Ramius Sergei Chiang Alexander MacClintock, Heir Tertiary to the Throne of Man. <i>March to the Stars</i> continues the adventures of Roger and the Bronze Barbarians that started in <i>March Upcountry</i> and continued in <i>March to the Sea</i> as they battle their way across the remote planet of Marduk in their bid to return home to Earth. Through the course of these first three novels, Roger has grown from a spoiled brat into a true leader of men and aliens alike. <i>March to the Stars</i> takes the Bronze Barbarians of the Imperial Guard across the Eastern Ocean of Marduk, facing giant sea monsters and pirates, and eventually to a spaceport held by humans of questionable loyalties.

S. Abbey was called &#x201c;the Dark Lord,&#x201d; &#x201c;the Godfather,&#x201d; and &#x201c;UNO&#x201d;&#x2014;short&nbsp;for unidentified NASA official.&nbsp;He was said to be secretive, despotic, a Space Age Machiavelli. Yet Abbey had more influence on human spaceflight than almost anyone in history. His story has never been told&#x2014;until now.<br><i>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Astronaut Maker</i> takes readers inside NASA to learn the real story of how Abbey rose to power, from young pilot and wannabe astronaut to engineer, bureaucrat, and finally director of the Johnson Space Center. During a thirty-seven-year career, mostly out of the spotlight, he oversaw the selection of every astronaut class from 1978 to 1987, deciding who got to fly and when.&nbsp;He was with the Apollo 1 astronauts the night before the fatal fire&nbsp;in January 1967. He was in mission control the night of the Apollo 13 accident and organized the recovery effort. Abbey also led NASA&#x2019;s recruitment of women and minorities as space shuttle astronauts and was responsible for hiring Sally Ride.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Written by Michael Cassutt,&nbsp;the coauthor of the acclaimed astronaut memoirs <i>DEKE!</i> and <i>We Have Capture,</i> and informed by countless hours of interviews with Abbey and his family, friends, adversaries, and former colleagues, <i>The Astronaut Maker </i>is the ultimate insider&#x2019;s account of ambition and power politics at NASA.</p><p><b>Michael Cassutt</b>&nbsp;is the coauthor of <i>DEKE!</i>, the autobiography of astronaut Donald K. &#x201c;Deke&#x201d; Slayton, and <i>We Have Capture</i>, the autobiography of astronaut Lt. Gen. Thomas Stafford, and the author of three editions of <i>Who&#x2019;s Who in Space</i> (1987, 1993, 1999). He has also written eight space-themed novels and thirty short stories published in <i>Isaac Asimov&#x2019;s Science Fiction</i> and elsewhere.

You watch your language!&#x201d;</p><p>Nick sighed at his mother&#x2019;s sharp tone as he stood in their tiny kitchen looking down at the bright orange Hawaiian shirt. The color and style were bad enough, the fact it was covered in l-a-r-g-e pink, gray and white trout (or were they salmon?) was even worse. &#x201c;Mom, I can&#x2019;t wear this to school. It&#x2019;s...&#x201d; he paused to think real hard of a word that wouldn&#x2019;t get him grounded for life&#x2013; &#x201c;hideous. If anyone sees me in this, I&#x2019;ll be an outcast relegated to the loser corner of the cafeteria.&#x201d;</p><p>As always, she scoffed at his protest. &#x201c;Oh shush. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with that shirt. Wanda told me at the Goodwill store that it came in from one of those big mansions down in the Garden District. That shirt belonged to the son of a fine upstanding man and since that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m raising you to be...&#x201d;</p><p>Nick ground his teeth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather be a delinquent no one picks on.&#x201d;</p><p>She let out a deep sound of aggravation as she paused while flipping bacon. &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s going to pick on you, Nicky. The school has a strict no bullying policy.&#x201d;</p><p>Yeah, right. That wasn&#x2019;t worth the &#x201c;contract&#x201d; paper it was written on. Especially since the bullies were illiterate idiots who couldn&#x2019;t read it anyway.</p><p>Jeez. Why wouldn&#x2019;t she listen to him? It wasn&#x2019;t like he wasn&#x2019;t the one going into the lion&#x2019;s den everyday and having to traverse the brutality of high school land mines. Honestly, he was sick of it and there was nothing he could do.</p><p>He was a massive loser dork and no one at school ever let him forget that. Not the teachers, the principal and especially not the other students.</p><p>Why can&#x2019;t I flash forward and bypass this whole high school nightmare?</p><p>Because his mom wouldn&#x2019;t let him. Only hoodlums dropped out of school and she didn&#x2019;t work as hard as she did to raise up another piece of worthless scum&#x2013; it was a harped on litany permanently carved into his brain. It ranked right up there with:</p><p>Be a good boy, Nicky. Graduate. Go to college. Get a good job. Marry a good girl. Have lots of grandbabies and never miss a holy day of obligation at church. His mom had already road mapped his entire future with no diversions or pit stops allowed.</p><p>But at the end of the day, he loved his mom and appreciated everything she did for him. Except for this whole, do what I say, Nicky. I&#x2019;m not listening to you because I know better thing, she said all the time.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t stupid and he wasn&#x2019;t a troublemaker. She had no idea what he went through at school and every time he tried to explain it, she refused to listen. It was so frustrating.</p><p>Gah, can&#x2019;t I catch swine flu or something? Just for the next four years until he was able to graduate and move on to a life that didn&#x2019;t include constant humiliation? After all, the swine flu had killed millions of people in 1918 and several more during outbreaks in the seventies and eighties. Was it too much to ask that another mutant strain of it incapacitate him for a few years?</p><p>Maybe a good bout of Parvo...</p><p>You&#x2019;re not a dog, Nick.</p><p>True, no dog would be caught dead wearing this shirt. Whizzing on it would be another matter...</p><p>Sighing in useless angst, he looked down at the crap shirt he wanted desperately to burn. Okay fine. He&#x2019;d do what he always did whenever his mom made him look like a flaming moron.</p><p>He&#x2019;d own it.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to own this. I look like epically stupid.</p><p>Man-up, Nick. You can take it. You&#x2019;ve taken a lot worse.</p><p>Yeah, all right. Fine. Let them laugh. He couldn&#x2019;t stop that anyway. If it wasn&#x2019;t the shirt, they&#x2019;d humiliate him over something else. His shoes. His haircut. And if all else failed, they&#x2019;d insult his name. Didn&#x2019;t matter what he said or did, those who mocked would mock anything. Because some people were just wired wrong and they couldn&#x2019;t live unless they were making other people suffer.</p><p>His Aunt Menyara always said, no one could make him feel inferior unless he allowed them to.</p><p>Problem was, he allowed it a lot more than he wanted to.</p><p>His mom set a chipped blue plate on the side of the rusted out stove. &#x201c;Sit down, baby, and eat something. I was reading in a magazine that someone left at the club that kids score much higher on tests and do a lot better in school whenever they have breakfast.&#x201d; She smiled and held the package of bacon up for him to see. &#x201c;And look. It&#x2019;s not expired this time.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed at something that really wasn&#x2019;t funny. One of the guys who came into his mom&#x2019;s club was a local grocer who would give them meat sometimes when it expired since all the guy did was throw it out anyway.</p><p>As long as we eat it quick, it won&#x2019;t make us sick.</p><p>Another litany he hated.</p><p>Picking up the crispy bacon, he glanced around the tiny condo they called home. It was one of four that had been carved out of an old rundown house. Made up of three small rooms- the kitchen/living room, his mom&#x2019;s bedroom and the bathroom- it wasn&#x2019;t much, but it was theirs and his mom was proud of it so he tried to be proud too.</p><p>Most days.</p><p>He winced as he looked at his corner where his mom had strung up dark blue blankets to make a room for him on his last birthday. His clothes were kept in an old laundry basket on the floor set next to his mattress that was covered with Star Wars sheets he&#x2019;d had since he was nine&#x2013; another present his mom had picked up at a yard sale.</p><p>&#x201c;One day, Mom, I&#x2019;m going to buy us a really nice house.&#x201d; With really nice stuff in it.</p><p>She smiled, but her eyes said she didn&#x2019;t believe a word he spoke. &#x201c;I know you will, baby. Now eat up and get to school. I don&#x2019;t want you dropping out like me.&#x201d; She paused as a hurt look flitted across her face. &#x201c;You can see exactly what that gets you.&#x201d;</p><p>Guilt cut through him. He was the reason his mom had dropped out of school. As soon as her parents had learned she was pregnant, they&#x2019;d offered her one choice.</p><p>Give up the baby or give up her nice home in Kenner, her education and her family.</p><p>For reasons he still didn&#x2019;t understand, she&#x2019;d chosen him.</p><p>It was something Nick never let himself forget. But one day he was going to get all that back for her. She deserved it and for her, he&#x2019;d wear this godawful shirt.</p><p>Even if it got him killed...</p><p>And he&#x2019;d smile through the pain of it until Stone and his crew kicked his teeth in.</p><p>Trying not to think about the butt-whipping to come, Nick ate his bacon in silence. Maybe Stone wouldn&#x2019;t be in school today. He could get malaria or the plague, or rabies or something.</p><p>Yeah, may the smarmy freak get a pox on his privates.</p><p>That thought actually made him smile as he shoved the grainy powdered eggs in his mouth and swallowed them. He forced himself not to shiver at the taste. But it was all they could afford.</p><p>He glanced at the clock on the wall and jerked. &#x201c;Gotta go. I&#x2019;m going to be late.&#x201d;</p><p>She grabbed him for a bear hug.</p><p>Nick grimaced. &#x201c;Stop sexually harassing me, Mom. I gotta go before I get another tardy.&#x201d;</p><p>She popped him on the butt cheek before she released him. &#x201c;Sexually harassing you. Boy, you have no idea.&#x201d; She ruffled his hair as he bent over to pick up his backpack.</p><p>Nick put both arms through the straps and hit the door running. He launched himself from the dilapidated porch and sprinted down the street, passed broken down cars and garbage cans to where the streetcar stopped.</p><p>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t be gone...&#x201d;</p><p>Otherwise he&#x2019;d be doomed to another &#x201c;Nick? What are we going to do with you, you white trash dirt?&#x201d; lecture from Mr. Peters. The old man hated his guts and the fact that Nick was a scholarship kid at his snotty over privileged school seriously ticked Peters off. He&#x2019;d like nothing better than to kick him out so that Nick wouldn&#x2019;t &#x201c;corrupt&#x201d; the kids from the good families.</p><p>Nick&#x2019;s lip curled as he tried not to think about the way those decent people looked at him like he was nothing. More than half their dads were regulars at the club where his mom worked, yet they were called decent while he and his mom were considered trash.</p><p>The hypocrisy of that didn&#x2019;t sit well with him. But it was what it was. He couldn&#x2019;t change anyone&#x2019;s mind but his own.</p><p>Nick put his head down and ran full speed as he saw the streetcar stopped at his station.</p><p>Oh man...</p><p>He picked up speed and he broke out into a dead run. He hit the platform and leapt for the streetcar. He&#x2019;d caught it just in time.</p><p>Panting and sweating from the humid autumn New Orleans air, he shrugged his backpack off as he greeted the driver. &#x201c;Morning Mr. Clemmons.&#x201d;</p><p>The elderly African American man smiled at him. He was one of Nick&#x2019;s favorite drivers. &#x201c;Morning, Mr. Gautier.&#x201d; He always mispronounced Nick&#x2019;s last name. He said it Go-chay instead of the correct Go-shay. The difference being Go-chay traditionally had an &#x201c;h&#x201d; in it after the &#x201c;t&#x201d; and as Nick&#x2019;s mom so often said, they were too poor for anymore letters. Not to mention, one of his mom&#x2019;s relatives, Fernando Upton Gautier, had founded the small town in Mississippi that shared his name and both were pronounced Go-shay. &#x201c;Your mom made you late again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know it.&#x201d; Nick dug his money out of his pocket and quickly paid before taking a seat. Winded and sweating, he leaned back and let out a deep breath, grateful he&#x2019;d made it in time.</p><p>Unfortunatel...</p></p><h2>Bizarre and Ornamental Alphabets (Lettering, Calligraphy, Typography)</h2><p>Animal alphabets, architectural lettering, exquisite florid expressions, the well known, the whimsical, and the inspired have been brought together in this fascinating, practical, and inexpensive pictorial archive sourcebook by graphic designer and artist Carol Belanger Grafton.<br>Here is an exquisite collection of unique and evocative lettering dating from an eleventh-century Anglo-Celtic alphabet right up to the present.

Studies on the Haggadah is based on the teachings of one of the outstanding Bible teachers of our generation, Nechama Leibowitz, presenting over 100 analytical questions relating to the Passover Seder and the Exodus from Egypt. Questions extracted from Nechama&#39;s renowned weekly Torah study sheets guide the reader through an analysis of the Haggadah text, and the sources upon which it is based. Suggested answers are provided by the editors, two former students of Nechama. The full text of the Passover Haggadah appears in the original Hebrew with English translation. The commentary is in English.</p><p><b>Yitshak Reiner </b>is the former director of the department for seminars and advanced courses in the department of education of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem and the former principal of Tahkemoni Jewish Day School in Antwerp, Belgium.

He studied with Nechama Leibowitz for several years and is the author of <i>To Study and to Teach: The Methodology of Nechama Leibowitz</i>.Before her death in 1997, Nechama Leibowitz was perhaps the best-known Bible teacher in Israel, if not the world. Her terse essays on the Five Books of Moses, always followed by questions for the reader to unravel, drew on the classic rabbinic commentators as well as modern trends in literary criticism and linguistics. She was no liberal, but she invited a wide-open discussion of text across religious and ideological boundaries and remained throughout her life a role model for Jewish educators, especially women.<br><br>In Studies on the Haggadah: From the Teachings of Nechama Leibowitz, editors Yitshak Reiner and Shmuel Peerless have distilled Leibowitz's teachings on all aspects of the Seder observance, from the four cups of wine to the bitter herbs. The full text of the Haggada is included, but the book will be most useful in the hands of a good Seder leader, who can offer up Leibowitz's insights and challenge the guests to find new meanings in passages they have read - or, more likely, skimmed - dozens of times. --Andrew Silow-Carroll, Forward<br><br>Like a key that unlocks the door to a room of buried treasure, Haggadat Nechama enables the reader to touch, as if holding in her hand, newer, more shining and beautiful jewels of understanding into the paradigmatic learning experience we call the Passover Seder. --Mordechai Ben-Dat, The Canadian Jewish News<br><br>The learned market segment which traditionally leans to Artscroll has other options to expand their Seder fare.

This is the first cookbook written by an American author specifically published for American kitchens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br><br>Named by the Library of Congress as one of the 88 "Books That Shaped America," <i>American Cookery</i> was the first cookbook by an American author published in the United States.&nbsp;Until its publication, cookbooks printed and used by American colonists were British. As indicated in Amelia Simmons&#x2019;s subtitle, the recipes in her book were &#x201c;adapted to this country,&#x201d; reflecting the fact that American cooks had learned to make do with what was available in North America.&nbsp;This cookbook reveals the rich variety of food colonial Americans used, their tastes, cooking and eating habits, and even their rich, down-to-earth language.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Bringing together English cooking methods with truly American products,&nbsp;<i>American Cookery</i>&nbsp;contains the first known printed recipes substituting American maize for English oats; and the recipe for Johnny Cake is apparently the first printed version using cornmeal. The book also contains the first known recipe for turkey. Possibly the most far-reaching innovation was Simmons&#x2019;s use of pearlash&#x2014;a staple in colonial households as a leavening agent in dough, which eventually led to the development of modern baking powders.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Thus, twenty years after the political upheaval of the American Revolution of 1776, a second revolution&#x2014;a culinary revolution&#x2014;occurred with the publication of a cookbook by an American for Americans.&#x201d; (Jan Longone, curator of American Culinary History, University of Michigan)<br><br>This facsimile edition of Amelia Simmons's&nbsp;<i>American Cookery&nbsp;</i>was reproduced by permission from the volume in the collection of the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Massachusetts. Founded in 1812 by Isaiah Thomas, a Revolutionary War patriot and successful printer and publisher, the Society is a research library documenting the life of Americans from the colonial era through 1876. The Society collects, preserves, and makes available as complete a record as possible of the printed materials from the early American experience. The cookbook collection includes approximately 1,100 volumes.</p><p>There is no formal biography of Amelia Simmons available, except what is listed on the cover of her cookbook:&nbsp;&#x201c;Amelia Simmons, an American orphan.&#x201d;&nbsp;From the language of the book and its publishing history, culinary historians have deduced that she was most likely a domestic servant without formal education. (She describes enlisting a transcriber to write out the book for her.) Simmons probably came from the Hudson Valley region, and the basic content of the recipes indicates that she was a &#x201c;good plain cook,&#x201d; to substantiate the theory of her origins.</p><h2>Transforming Trauma: EMDR: The Revolutionary New Therapy for Freeing the Mind, Clearing the Body, and Opening the Heart</h2><p><p><strong>The revolutionary new therapy for freeing the mind, clearing the body, and opening the heart.</strong></p> Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR�) has helped thousands of clients haunted by abuse histories or recent traumatic events. It also benefits patients who have not found relief with other therapies and those with chronic conditions or blocked personal and professional performance.<br><br> EMDR� therapy incorporates eye movements into a comprehensive approach that processes and releases information trapped in the body-mind, freeing people from disturbing images and body sensations, debilitating emotions, and restrictive beliefs. Not only does healing occur much more rapidly than in traditional therapy, but clients also experience a sense of joy, openness, and deep connection with others. EMDR� seems to be a quantum leap in the human ability to heal trauma and maladaptive beliefs.</p><p>Laurel Parnell, Ph.D., PhD, is one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on EMDR. She is the author of two previous books on&nbsp;EMDR,&nbsp;EMDR in the Treatment of Adults Abused as Children and Transforming Trauma:&nbsp;EMDR&nbsp;as well as articles and a book chapter. A clinical psychologist, she has trained thousands in EMDR through her international workshops. She is author of several books on EMDR and lives in San Rafael, California.EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is a controversial method of psychotherapy used for treating posttraumatic stress syndrome and anxiety disorders. These two books provide an overview of EMDR for the general reader. Supporters claim that EMDR releases traumatic memories locked in the brain, accelerates recovery, and reduces stress; opponents point out that a neurological basis for this theory has yet to be established. These two new books on EMRR chiefly contain case histories and descriptions of the therapy; both warn against unauthorized use by therapists not trained by the EMDR Institute. Parnell, a clinical psychologist and senior EMDR Institute facilitator, claims a transcendent focus for EMDR, leading to "objective forgiveness" of oneself and the perpetrator of the trauma. Shapiro, who developed EMDR in 1989, documents research supporting EMDR, citing both controlled and uncontrolled studies and listing 12 populations where EMDR has been effectively used as a form of treatment.

One of our major political analysts explores the deeply held but often inarticulated beliefs that shape the American creed.</strong></p> "American values are quite complex," writes Seymour Martin Lipset, "particularly because of paradoxes within our culture that permit pernicious and beneficial social phenomena to arise simultaneously from the same basic beliefs."<br><br> Born out of revolution, the United States has always considered itself an exceptional country of citizens unified by an allegiance to a common set of ideals, individualism, anti-statism, populism, and egalitarianism. This ideology, Professor Lipset observes, defines the limits of political debate in the United States and shapes our society.<br><br><em>American Exceptionalism</em> explains why socialism has never taken hold in the United States, why Americans are resistant to absolute quotas as a way to integrate blacks and other minorities, and why American religion and foreign policy have a moralistic, crusading streak.</p><p>Seymour Martin Lipset is the Hazel Professor of Public Policy at George Mason University and a fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.&#x201c;[A] magisterial attempt to distill a lifetime of learning about America into a persuasive brief . . .

He calls these foods &#x201c;negative calorie foods&#x201d;&#x2014;foods that help you to burn body fat, lose weight, and boost your metabolism. These whole foods are packed with fiber, so not only do you tend to eat smaller portions of them naturally, but you also stay fuller, longer. These nutritious superfoods offer the essential vitamins and minerals the body needs to keep your metabolism running efficiently.

The secret to fast, lasting weight loss isn&#x2019;t how much you eat&#x2014;it&#x2019;s what you eat.</p><p>Eating high-quality, whole foods causes the body to burn fat and lose weight, while eating low-quality, processed foods causes the body to store fat and gain weight. A diet rich in real, unprocessed foods is a satisfying way to lose weight for people who love to eat.&nbsp; Because not only does it offer the vitamins and nutrients your body needs to fuel your metabolism, it also allows you to eat unlimited quantities of delicious, satisfying foods. Some whole foods even offer what is known as a &#x201c;thermogenic effect&#x201d;&#x2014;boosting the rate at which your body burns calories. In short: eating the right foods can have a negative calorie effect!</p><p>In <em>The Negative Calorie Diet</em>, #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, chef, and healthy-living expert Rocco DiSpirito identifies the top ten negative calorie foods for rapid weight loss and offers mouth-watering recipes for making negative calorie meals at home.

My cheeks burn as I climb onto my bike, pedaling fast down the rue Cler, past the street vendors with their tables lined with shiny purple eggplants and bunches of flowers, pink peonies and golden sunflowers standing at attention in tidy buckets, past Caf� du Monde, where I sometimes get a coffee when I&#x2019;m too tired to walk to Bistro Jeanty, past an old woman walking her tiny white poodle. Despite the bright sun overhead, she pessimistically clutches a sheathed umbrella, as if at any moment the skies might open and unleash their fury.<br><br>Fury is the emotion I feel. Furious, rather. He was the last person on earth I expected or wanted to see this morning. After everything that&#x2019;s happened, does he not have the decency to respect my wishes? I told him I didn&#x2019;t want to see him, now or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ever. And yet, here he materializes, at Caf� du Monde of all places, smiling at me as if nothing has happened, as if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br>I blink back tears, careful to regain my composure, the way I didn&#x2019;t last night, when I threw down my napkin, shouted at him, and stormed off. A Parisian woman, in contrast, would never lose her cool like that.<br><br>While I have a lot to work on in that department, on any given day I might pass for French, at least from a distance. I look the part, more or less. Scarf tied loosely around my neck. On a bike in a dress. Blond hair swept up in a high bun. No helmet&#x2014;�obviously. It has taken three years to semi-�master the language (emphasis on the &#x201c;semi&#x201d;), but it would easily take a lifetime to become adequately versed in French style.<br><br>But what does any of it matter now? Over time, Paris has become my hiding place, my cocoon, my escape from the pain of the past. I blink back tears. And now? Does he really think he can just waltz in and expect me to behave as if nothing happened? That everything should just magically go back to the way it was?<br><br>I shudder, glancing over my shoulder to make sure he isn&#x2019;t following me. As far as I can tell, he&#x2019;s not, and I pedal faster around the next corner, where a man in a leather jacket catches my eye and smiles as though we&#x2019;ve met before. We haven&#x2019;t. Saying that Frenchmen are notoriously forward is an understatement. The truth is, they believe the world, and every woman in it, should be so lucky to be graced by their special good looks, charm, and intelligence.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve barely dipped my toe into the pool of French dating, and the experience hasn&#x2019;t been great. There was dinner with the hairstylist, who couldn&#x2019;t stop checking himself out in the mirror behind me; lunch with the artist, who suggested we go back to his apartment and discuss his latest painting, which, by chance, hung over his bed; and then the professor who asked me out last week&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and yet I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to return his calls.<br><br>I sigh and pedal on. I am neither American nor Parisian. In fact, these days, I don&#x2019;t feel as if I&#x2019;m anything. I belong to no country or person. Unattached, I am merely a ghost, floating through life.<br><br>I wend past the rue de Seine, zigzagging down a lamppost-�lined hill, the grandeur of the city at my back, my pale-�blue sundress fluttering in the breeze as more tears well up in my eyes, fogging my view of the narrow street below. I blink hard, wiping away a tear, and the expanse of cobblestones comes into focus again. My eyes fix on an elderly couple walking on the sidewalk ahead. They are like any older French couple, I suppose, characteristically adorable in a way that they will never know. He in a sport coat (despite the humid eighty-�five-�degree day), and she in a gingham dress, perhaps in her closet since the afternoon she saw it in the window of a sensible boutique along the Champs-��lys�es in 1953. She carries a basket filled with farmers&#x2019;-�market finds (I notice the zucchini). He carries a baguette, and nothing else, like a World War II&#x2013;�era rifle held against his shoulder, dutifully, but also with a barely detectable and oddly charming tinge of annoyance.<br><br>My mind returns to the exchange at the caf�, and I am once again furious. I hear his voice in my head, soft, sweet, pleading. Was I too hard on him? No. No. Maybe? No! In another life, we might have spent this evening nestled in a corner table at some caf�, drinking good Bordeaux, listening to Chet Baker, discussing hypothetical trips to the Greek islands or the construction of a backyard greenhouse where we would consider the merits of growing a lemon (or avocado?) tree in a pot and sit under a bougainvillea vine like the one my mom planted the year I turned eleven, before my dad left. Jazz. Santorini. Lemon trees. Beautiful, loving details, none of which matter anymore. Not in this life, anyhow. That chapter has ended. No, the book has.<br><br>How could I forgive him? How could I ever forgive him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br>&#x201c;Forgiveness is a gift,&#x201d; a therapist I saw for a few sessions had said, &#x201c;both to the receiver and to yourself. But no one can give a gift when she&#x2019;s not ready to.&#x201d;<br><br>I close my eyes for a moment, then open them, resolute. I am not ready now, and I doubt that I will ever be. I pedal on, faster, determined. The pain of the past suddenly comes into sharp and bitter focus. It stings, like a slice of lemon pressed to a wound.<br><br>I wipe away another tear as a truck barrels toward me out of nowhere. Adrenaline surges in the way it does when you&#x2019;re zoning out while driving and then narrowly miss swerving into an oncoming car, or a light post, or a man walking his dog. I veer my bicycle to the right, careful to avoid a mother and her young daughter walking toward me on my left. The little girl looks no older than two. My heart swells. The sun is bright, blindingly so, and it filters through her sandy blond hair.<br><br>I squint, attempting to navigate the narrow road ahead, my heart beating faster by the second. The driver of the truck doesn&#x2019;t seem to see me. &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; I cry. &#x201c;Arr�tez!&#x201d;<br><br>I clench the handlebars, engaging the brakes, but somehow they give out. The street is steep and narrow, too narrow, and I am now barreling down a hillside with increasing speed. The driver of the truck is fiddling with a cigarette, turning it this way and that, simultaneously swerving the truck across the cobblestone streets. I scream again, but he doesn&#x2019;t seem to hear. Panic washes over me, thick and overpowering. I have two choices: turn left and crash my bike straight into the mother and her little girl, or turn right and collide directly into the truck.<br><br>I turn right.<br><br>CHAPTER 2<br><br>�<br><br>C�LINE<br><br>SEPTEMBER 4, 1943<br><br>Paris, France<br><br>&#x201c;Autumn&#x2019;s coming,&#x201d; Papa says, casting his gaze out the window of our little flower shop on the rue Cler. Despite the blue sky overhead, there are storm clouds in his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Papa,&#x201d; I say through the open door, straightening my apron before sweeping a few stray rose petals off the cobblestones in front of the shop. I always feel bad for fallen petals, as silly as that sounds. They&#x2019;re like little lost ducklings separated from their mama. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only the beginning of September, my oh-�so-�very-�pessimistic papa.&#x201d; I smile facetiously. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been the most beautiful summer; can&#x2019;t we just enjoy it while it lasts?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Beautiful?&#x201d; Papa throws his arms in the air in the dramatic fashion that all Frenchmen over the age of sixty do so well. I&#x2019;ve often thought that there&#x2019;s probably an old French law stating that if you&#x2019;re an older male, you have the irrevocable right to be grumpy, cantankerous, and otherwise disagreeable at the time and place of your choosing. Papa certainly exercises this right, and yet I love him all the more for it. Grumpy or not, he still has the biggest heart of any Frenchman I&#x2019;ve ever known. &#x201c;Our city is occupied by Nazi soldiers and you call this summer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. beautiful?&#x201d; He shakes his head, returning to an elaborate arrangement he&#x2019;s been fussing over all day for Madame Jeanty, one of our more exacting clients. A local tastemaker, and owner of one of the most fashionable restaurants in town, Bistro Jeanty, she funnels many clients to us, namely, new admissions into the high-�society circle who want their dining room tables to look as grand as hers. As such, Papa and I know we can&#x2019;t risk losing her business, and her demands must always be heeded, no matter how ridiculous, or how late (or early) the hour. Never too much greenery, but then never too little, either. Only roses that have been snipped that morning. Never peonies, only ranunculus. And for the love of all that is holy, no ferns. Not even a hint of them. I made that mistake in an arrangement three years ago, and let&#x2019;s just say it will never happen again.<br><br>It&#x2019;s funny how different a child can be from a parent. Her son, Luc, for instance, is nothing like her. We&#x2019;ve known each other since secondary school, and I&#x2019;ve always thought the world of him. We have dinner together each week at Bistro Jeanty, and I&#x2019;ve valued our friendship, especially during this godforsaken occupation. Luc and I might have been sweethearts under different circumstances. If the world weren&#x2019;t at war, if our lives had taken different paths. I&#x2019;ve thought about it many times, of course, and I know he has too. The Book of Us remains a complicated story, and neither of us, it seems, knows the ending.</p><h2>Cute &amp; Clever Totes: Mix &amp; Match 16 Paper-Pieced Blocks, 6 Bag Patterns - Messenger Bag, Beach Tote, Bucket Bag &amp; More</h2><p>With all they do for us, don't purses deserve to have a little fun?

Even before the plane is located in waters off the Irish coast, the relentless scrutiny of her husband's life begins to bring a bizarre personal mystery into focus. Could there be any truth to the increasingly disturbing rumors that he had a secret life?<br></p><p>With five novels to her credit, including the acclaimed <i>The Weight of Water</i>, Anita Shreve now offers a skillfully crafted exploration of the long reach of tragedy in <i>The Pilot's Wife</i>. News of Jack Lyons's fatal crash sends his wife into shock and emotional numbness: "Kathryn wished she could manage a coma. Instead, it seemed that quite the opposite had happened: She felt herself to be inside of a private weather system, one in which she was continuously tossed and buffeted by bits of news and information, sometimes chilled by thoughts of what lay immediately ahead, thawed by the kindness of others ... frequently drenched by memories that seemed to have no regard for circumstance or place, and then subjected to the nearly intolerable heat of reporters, photographers and curious on-lookers. It was a weather system with no logic, she had decided, no pattern, no progression, no form." The situation becomes even more dire when the plane's black box is recovered, pinning responsibility for the crash on Jack. In an attempt to clear his name, Kathryn searches for any and all clues to the hours before the flight. Yet each discovery forces her to realize that she didn't know her husband of 16 years at all. Shreve's complex and highly convincing treatment of Kathryn's dilemma, coupled with intriguing minor characters and an expertly paced plot, makes <i>The Pilot's Wife</i> really take off.Praise for Anita Shreve's The Pilot's Wife <p>"Gripping. . . . A gentle romance and a tale of inner anguish. . . .

To create both sympathetic characters and an enticing plot is no small feat, but Shreve does it seamlessly. . . .

A thoughtful, often poignant novel." --Boston Magazine </p><p>"Oddly gripping." --Susan Salter Reynolds, Los Angeles Times Book Review </p><p>"The humanness of this novel, along with its attention to detail, makes this a provocative read. . . . While the story physically takes place in Ely, N.H., and extends to England and Ireland, there is much more exploration of a changing interior topogrpahy: the plateaus of normalcy, the valleys of sorrow, the vistas of strength. It is a story of a struggle to become self-reliant." --Angela Glaser, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel </p><p>"From cover to rapidly reached cover, The Pilot's Wife is beautifully plotted, tensely paced, and thoroughly absorbing." --Heller McAlpin, New York Newsday</p></p><h2>Washington Square (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>A masterful novel of New York society by a champion of literary realism</b><br><br>When timid and plain Catherine Sloper acquires a dashing and determined suitor, her father, convinced that the young man is nothing more than a fortune-hunter, decides to put a stop to their romance. Torn between her desire to win her father's love and approval and her passion for the first man who has ever declared his love for her, Catherine faces an agonising dilemma, and becomes all too aware of the restrictions that others seek to place on her freedom.

When Catherine stubbornly refuses to call off her engagement, Dr. Sloper forces Catherine to choose between her inheritance and the only man she will ever truly love. Cynthia Ozick, in her Introduction to what she calls Henry James&#39;s &#34;most American fiction,&#34; writes that &#34;every line, every paragraph, every chapter [of Washington Square] is a fleet-footed light brigade, an engine of irony.&#34; Precise and understated, this charming novel endures as a matchless study of New York in the mid-nineteenth century.&#x201c;Henry James is as solitary in the history of the novel as Shakespeare is in the history of poetry.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Graham Greene</b></p><h2>The Dream of Rome</h2><p><p>In addition to his roles as politician, editor, author and television presenter, Boris Johnson is a passionate Roman scholar.

It is time we spoke of Skullyville." Thus begins Rose Goode's story of her growing up in Indian Territory in pre-statehood Oklahoma. Skullyville, a once-thriving Choctaw community, was destroyed by land-grabbers, culminating in the arson on New Year's Eve, 1896, of New Hope Academy for Girls. Twenty Choctaw girls died, but Rose escaped. She is blessed by the presence of her grandmother Pokoni and her grandfather Amafo, both respected elders who understand the old ways. Soon after the fire, the white sheriff beats Amafo in front of the town's people, humiliating him. Instead of asking the Choctaw community to avenge the beating, her grandfather decides to follow the path of forgiveness. And so unwinds this tale of mystery, Indian-style magical realism, and deep wisdom. It's a world where backwoods spiritualism and Bible-thumping Christianity mix with bad guys; a one-legged woman shop-keeper, her oaf of a husband, herbal potions, and shape-shifting panthers rendering justice. Tim Tingle&#x2014;a scholar of his nation's language, culture, and spirituality&#x2014;tells Rose's story of good and evil with understanding and even laugh-out-loud Choctaw humor.</p><p><b>Tim Tingle</b>, responding to a scarcity of Choctaw literature, began interviewing tribal elders in the early '90s.

In making accessible some of the best contemporary historical, literary, political, and feminist readings of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, it encourages all who would find in the biblical heritage an ally and not an enemy in the quest for a more just and humane world. Brief and to the point, it can easily be used to stimulate group discussions and personal reading of the biblical texts themselves, and is an excellent introduction to the Judeo-Christian tradition for those of other faiths.<br><br><i>Understanding the Bible</i> includes four preliminary chapters on the why, who, which, and how of biblical understanding, followed by eight brief thematic chapters covering the core of the Hebrew Bible and six covering the Christian scriptures, plus chronologies, maps, and helpful suggestions for further reading.</p><p>John Buehrens was president of the Unitarian Universalist Association from 1993 to 2001 and is now minister of the First Parish in Needham, Massachusetts, and special assistant to the secretary general of the World Conference of Religions for Peace. He is coauthor, with Forrest Church, of <i>A Chosen Faith</i>.'Biblical literacy is not just for Biblical literalists. To grasp the nuances of Western art and literature or the religious subtext of Western law and society requires a working knowledge of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures. Yet, to the uninitiated, the Bible is daunting. One opens its pages only to get lost in its maze. John Buehrens has performed a great service for the many religious liberals and seekers who would explore the Bible if only they could find a trusted guide. Addressed to thoughtful skeptics who know enough to be skeptical of their own ignorance, Understanding the Bible is an accessible, unpretentious introduction to the most influential writings of all time.' --Forrest Church, author of <i>The American Creed and Lifecraft: The Art of Meaning in the Everyday</i><br><br>'<i>Understanding the Bible</i> is a thoughtful and honest introduction to the tragedy, compassion, mercy, justice, grief, and ecstasy that we share with the tellers of biblical stories and with the stories themselves. Read Buehren's enlightening as well as entertaining work and you almost certainly will find yourself learning, thinking, and laughing as you reach for a copy of the Bible to read it again or for the first time.' --C. Welton Gaddy, President, The Interfaith Alliance<br><br>'Spiritual seekers of a liberal persuasion have too often dismissed the Bible, perhaps because of unhappy childhood experiences with literal interpretations. The Bible is neither history nor science, but rather stories of human struggle and divine presence throughout that struggle. John Buehrens engages us in the powerful stories of the Judeo Christian scripture, returning to us a rich heritage without which we would be both culturally and spiritually impoverished.' --Marilyn Sewell, editor of <i>Cries of the Spirit</i><br><br>'If with Saint Augustine, you 'believe in thinking and wish to think in believing,' John Buehrens' book is for you. He spells out clearly the historic importance and textual complexities of the Bible, which then enables you to stand face to face, soul to soul, with blazing biblical insights sorely needed in these dark days.' --William Sloane Coffin, author of <i>A Passion for the Possible</i></p><h2>The Angel of History</h2><p><p>Placed in the context of twentieth-century moral disaster--war, genocide, the Holocaust, the atomic bomb--Forche's ambitious and compelling third collection of poems is a meditation of memory, specifically how memory survives the unimaginable. The poems reflect the effects of such experience: the lines, and often the images within them, are fragmented discordant. But read together, these lines become a haunting mosaic of grief, evoking the necessary accommodations human beings make to survive what is unsurvivable. As poets have always done, Forche attempts to give voice to the unutterable, using language to keep memory alive, relive history, and link the past with the future. </p></p><p><p>Carolyn Forch� is the author of <em>Gathering the Tribes,</em> winner of the Yale Younger Poets Award; <em>The Country Between Us,</em> which received awards from the Academy of American Poets and the Poetry Society of America; and <em>The Angel of History,</em> awarded the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Award. She is also the editor of the anthology <em>Against Forgetting: Twentieth-Centuly Poetry of Witness.</em> Recently she was presented with the Edita and Ira Morris Hiroshima Foundation Award for Peace and Culture in Stockholm. She lives in Maryland with her husband and son.</p>Though Forche's ( The Country Between Us ) previous books have been groundbreaking works of political and moral depth, this new volume may be the most remarkable. Ambitious and authentic, The Angel of History is an overarching book-length poem, composed in numbered sections, that invokes the horror of contemporary times in a mode reminiscent of Eliot's "The Waste Land." Much as Eliot's poem refracted WW I, the vacuity of culture and the fragmentation of modern life, Forche considers the Holocaust, Hiroshima and genocide in Latin America--the dismal past that predicates the chaotic present. Her vehicle is the Angel of History, who confronts human cruelty and misery but can do no more than record them, as explained by Walter Benjamin in an epigraph: "The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But . . . the storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward." Though the poetry is powerful, it is not always easily understandable; one must follow the Angel through serpentine lines, a disjointed and oblique nightmare whispered by an indeterminate narrator, and a splintered pastiche that borrows apocalyptic phrases from Elie Wiesel, Kafka, Canetti, Trakl, Char and Valery. But the journey ventured is well worth the occasional wrong turn: Forche has not only created poetry of consummate beauty, but has borne witness to the wounds of our collective history, fulfilling the conviction that "surely all art is the result of one's having been in danger, of having gone through an experience all the way to the end." <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>All the Flowers are Dying (Matthew Scudder)</h2><p><p>A man in a Virginia prison awaits execution for three horrific murders he must have committed but swears he didn't . . .</p><p>An aging investigator in New York City has seen too much and lost too much -- and is ready to leave the darkness behind . . .</p><p>But a nightmare is coming home -- because a brilliant, savage, patient monster has unfinished business in the big city . . . and a hunger that can be satisfied only by fear and the slow, agonizing death of Matthew Scudder and the woman he loves.</p></p><p><p>Lawrence Block is one of the most widely recognized names in the mystery genre. He has been named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America and is a four-time winner of the prestigious Edgar and Shamus Awards, as well as a recipient of prizes in France, Germany, and Japan. He received the Diamond Dagger from the British Crime Writers' Association&#x2014;only the third American to be given this award. He is a prolific author, having written more than fifty books and numerous short stories, and is a devoted New Yorker and an enthusiastic global traveler.</p>With a title taken from the ballad "Danny Boy," Lawrence Block's sixteenth novel to feature Matthew Scudder is his darkest in years. When a woman he meets at an AA meeting asks him to check the background of her new boyfriend, Scudder finds his path crossed with that of a brilliant serial killer who changes his methods at will and leaves virtually no trace of his identity. Alan Sklar reads the novel with his customary professional precision. It isn't only his baritone vibrato that helps maintain Block's dark mood, but the way in which timing, pacing, and the subtlest vocal nuances define the characters as he narrates Scudder's close and unforgettable brush with evil. S.E.S. � AudioFile 2005, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Hooking Up</h2><p><p>In <i>Hooking Up</i>, Tom Wolfe ranges from coast to coast observing 'the lurid carnival actually taking place in the mightiest country on earth in the year 2000.' From teenage sexual manners and mores to fundamental changes in the way human beings now regard themselves thanks to the hot new fields of genetics and neuroscience; from his legendary profile of William Shawn, editor of <i>The New Yorker </i>(first published in 1965), to a remarkable portrait of Bob Noyce, the man who invented Silicon Valley, Tom Wolfe the master of reportage and satire returns in vintage form.</p></p><p>Tom Wolfe's name is now so well known that the cover of his new collection bears just that: Tom Wolfe's name. No title, no picture, just the name, with an elegant design twining through it. Flip the thing on its side and you'll find that its title, <i>Hooking Up</i>, gives little idea of its function. But investigation soon reveals an oleo of reportage, fiction, and acrimonious name-calling. The latter, of course, makes for the best reading. In "My Three Stooges," Wolfe reviles the three big men of American letters--Updike, Mailer, and Irving--who cast aspersions on his second novel. Apparently, "the allergens for jealousy were present. Both Updike and Mailer had books out at the same time as <i>A Man in Full</i>, and theirs had sunk without a bubble. With Irving there was the Dickens factor." Wolfe gets in a lot of figures about what a big hit <i>his</i> book was with the reading public, and a few gentle reminders about other writers who were big hits of their times--little guys like Twain and Tolstoy. <p> Equally bitter fun are his two famous 1965 satires from the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>. As always, Wolfe's titles lead you a good way into the actual stories: "Tiny Mummies! The True Story of the Ruler of 43rd Street's Land of the Walking Dead!" and "Lost in the Whichy Thickets: <i>The New Yorker</i>." Wolfe, clotheshorse of note, gets off some of his best cracks at the expense of <i>New Yorker</i> editor William Shawn's fashion sense: "He always seems to have on about twenty layers of clothes, about three button-up sweaters, four vests, a couple of shirts, two ties, it looks that way, a dark shapeless suit over the whole ensemble, and white cotton socks." The rest of the reported pieces are unexceptional, and while the novella <i>Ambush at Fort Bragg</i> makes the most of its setting--a <i>Dateline</i>-like newsmagazine--it lacks the irresistible momentum required to drag most readers into a novella. Still, it's fun to watch the author reprise his lifelong role of unlikely underdog: between his sniping at the literary elite and his mocking of the precious <i>New Yorker</i> set, Tom Wolfe makes like a defender of the common man. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p><p><b>Tom Wolfe</b> (1930-2018) was one of the founders of the New Journalism movement and the author of such contemporary classics as <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i>, <i>The Right Stuff</i>, and <i>Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers</i>, as well as the novels <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i>, <i>A Man in Full</i>, and <i>I Am Charlotte Simmons</i>.

But William Cavanaugh argues that religious fervor never left -- it has only migrated toward a new object of worship. In&nbsp;<i>Migrations of the Holy</i>&nbsp;he examines the disconcerting modern transfer of sacred devotion from the church to the nation-state.<br><br> In these chapters Cavanaugh cautions readers to be wary of a rigid separation of religion and politics that boxes in the church and sends citizens instead to the state for hope, comfort, and salvation as they navigate the risks and pains of mortal life. When nationality becomes the primary source of identity and belonging, he warns, the state becomes the god and idol of its own religion, the language of nationalism becomes a liturgy, and devotees willingly sacrifice their lives to serve and defend their country.<br><br> Cavanaugh urges Christians to resist this form of idolatry, to unthink the inevitability of the nation-state and its dreary party politics, to embrace radical forms of political pluralism that privilege local communities -- and to cling to an incarnational theology that weaves itself seamlessly and tangibly into all aspects of daily life and culture.<br><br> Read more about the book in a blog post by Cavanaugh on&nbsp;EerdWord.</p><p>William T.

Named by the social worker who found her when she was a mere child roaming that city&#39;s streets, Eve Dallas is a New York police detective who lives for her job. In over ten years on the force, she&#39;s seen it all - and knows her survival depends on her instincts. But she&#39;s going against every warning telling her not to get involved with Roarke, a charismatic Irish billionaire - and a suspect in Eve&#39;s latest murder investigation. But passion and seduction have rules of their own, and it&#39;s up to Eve to take a chance in the arms of a man she knows nothing about - except the addictive hunger of needing his touch.</p><p>J.D. Robb is the pseudonym of Nora Roberts, the number one NEW YORK TIMES bestselling author of more than one hundred novels. With more than 300 million copies of her books in print, and over 150 New York Times bestsellers to date, Nora Roberts is indisputably the most celebrated women&#39;s fiction writer today.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>What&#x2019;s past is prologue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Violence is as American as cherry pie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;RAP (HUBERT GEROLD) BROWN</p><p></p><p></p><p>chapter one</p><p>She woke in the dark. Through the slats on the window shades, the first murky hint of dawn slipped, slanting shadowy bars over the bed. It was like waking in a cell.</p><p>For a moment she simply lay there, shuddering, imprisoned, while the dream faded. After ten years on the force, Eve still had dreams.</p><p>Six hours before, she&#x2019;d killed a man, had watched death creep into his eyes. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time she&#x2019;d exercised maximum force, or dreamed. She&#x2019;d learned to accept the action and the consequences.</p><p>But it was the child that haunted her. The child she hadn&#x2019;t been in time to save. The child whose screams had echoed in the dreams with her own.</p><p>All the blood, Eve thought, scrubbing sweat from her face with her hands. Such a small little girl to have had so much blood in her. And she knew it was vital that she push it aside.</p><p>Standard departmental procedure meant that she would spend the morning in Testing. Any officer whose discharge of weapon resulted in termination of life was required to undergo emotional and psychiatric clearance before resuming duty. Eve considered the tests a mild pain in the ass.</p><p>She would beat them, as she&#x2019;d beaten them before.</p><p>When she rose, the overheads went automatically to low setting, lighting her way into the bath. She winced once at her reflection. Her eyes were swollen from lack of sleep, her skin nearly as pale as the corpses she&#x2019;d delegated to the ME.</p><p>Rather than dwell on it, she stepped into the shower, yawning.</p><p>&#x201c;Give me one oh one degrees, full force,&#x201d; she said and shifted so that the shower spray hit her straight in the face.</p><p>She let it steam, lathered listlessly while she played through the events of the night before. She wasn&#x2019;t due in Testing until nine, and would use the next three hours to settle and let the dream fade away completely.</p><p>Small doubts and little regrets were often detected and could mean a second and more intense round with the machines and the owl-eyed technicians who ran them.</p><p>Eve didn&#x2019;t intend to be off the streets longer than twenty-four hours.</p><p>After pulling on a robe, she walked into the kitchen and programmed her AutoChef for coffee, black; toast, light. Through her window she could hear the heavy hum of air traffic carrying early commuters to offices, late ones home. She&#x2019;d chosen the apartment years before because it was in a heavy ground and air pattern, and she liked the noise and crowds. On another yawn, she glanced out the window, followed the rattling journey of an aging airbus hauling laborers not fortunate enough to work in the city or by home-links.</p><p>She brought the <i>New York Times</i> up on her monitor and scanned the headlines while the faux caffeine bolstered her system. The AutoChef had burned her toast again, but she ate it anyway, with a vague thought of springing for a replacement unit.</p><p>She was frowning over an article on a mass recall of droid cocker spaniels when her tele-link blipped. Eve shifted to communications and watched her commanding officer flash onto the screen.</p><p>&#x201c;Commander.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant.&#x201d; He gave her a brisk nod, noted the still wet hair and sleepy eyes. &#x201c;Incident at Twenty-seven West Broadway, eighteenth floor. You&#x2019;re primary.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve lifted a brow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on Testing. Subject terminated at twenty-two thirty-five.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have override,&#x201d; he said, without inflection. &#x201c;Pick up your shield and weapon on the way to the incident. Code Five, lieutenant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; His face flashed off even as she pushed back from the screen. Code Five meant she would report directly to her commander, and there would be no unsealed interdepartmental reports and no cooperation with the press.</p><p>In essence, it meant she was on her own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Broadway was noisy and crowded, a party where rowdy guests never left. Street, pedestrian, and sky traffic were miserable, choking the air with bodies and vehicles. In her old days in uniform she remembered it as a hot spot for wrecks and crushed tourists who were too busy gaping at the show to get out of the way.</p><p>Even at this hour there was steam rising from the stationary and portable food stands that offered everything from rice noodles to soydogs for the teeming crowds. She had to swerve to avoid an eager merchant on his smoking Glida-Grill, and took his flipped middle finger as a matter of course.</p><p>Eve double-parked and, skirting a man who smelled worse than his bottle of brew, stepped onto the sidewalk. She scanned the building first, fifty floors of gleaming metal that knifed into the sky from a hilt of concrete. She was propositioned twice before she reached the door.</p><p>Since this five-block area of Broadway was affectionately termed Prostitute&#x2019;s Walk, she wasn&#x2019;t surprised. She flashed her badge for the uniform guarding the entrance.</p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; He skimmed his official compu-seal over the door to keep out the curious, then led the way to the bank of elevators. &#x201c;Eighteenth floor,&#x201d; he said when the doors swished shut behind them.</p><p>&#x201c;Fill me in, officer.&#x201d; Eve switched on her recorder and waited.</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t first on the scene, lieutenant. Whatever happened upstairs is being kept upstairs. There&#x2019;s a badge inside waiting for you. We have a Homicide, and a Code Five in number Eighteen-oh-three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who called it in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have that information.&#x201d;</p><p>He stayed where he was when the elevator opened. Eve stepped out and was alone in a narrow hallway. Security cameras tilted down at her and her feet were almost soundless on the worn nap of the carpet as she approached 1803. Ignoring the handplate, she announced herself, holding her badge up to eye level for the peep cam until the door opened.</p><p>&#x201c;Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Feeney.&#x201d; She smiled, pleased to see a familiar face. Ryan Feeney was an old friend and former partner who&#x2019;d traded the street for a desk and a top level position in the Electronics Detection Division. &#x201c;So, they&#x2019;re sending computer pluckers these days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They wanted brass, and the best.&#x201d; His lips curved in his wide, rumpled face, but his eyes remained sober. He was a small, stubby man with small, stubby hands and rust colored hair. &#x201c;You look beat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rough night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I heard.&#x201d; He offered her one of the sugared nuts from the bag he habitually carried, studying her, and measuring if she was up to what was waiting in the bedroom beyond.</p><p>She was young for her rank, barely thirty, with wide brown eyes that had never had a chance to be naive. Her doe-brown hair was cropped short, for convenience rather than style, but suited her triangular face with its razor-edge cheekbones and slight dent in the chin.</p><p>She was tall, rangy, with a tendency to look thin, but Feeney knew there were solid muscles beneath the leather jacket. More, there was a brain, and a heart.</p><p>&#x201c;This one&#x2019;s going to be touchy, Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I picked that up already. Who&#x2019;s the victim?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sharon DeBlass, granddaughter of Senator DeBlass.&#x201d;</p><p>Neither meant anything to her. &#x201c;Politics isn&#x2019;t my forte, Feeney.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The gentleman from Virginia, extreme right, old money. The granddaughter took a sharp left a few years back, moved to New York, and became a licensed companion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was a hooker.&#x201d; Dallas glanced around the apartment. It was furnished in obsessive modern&#x2014;glass and thin chrome, signed holograms on the walls, recessed bar in bold red. The wide mood screen behind the bar bled with mixing and merging shapes and colors in cool pastels.</p><p>Neat as a virgin, Eve mused, and cold as a whore. &#x201c;No surprise, given her choice of real estate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Politics makes it delicate. Victim was twenty-four, Caucasian female. She bought it in bed.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve only lifted a brow. &#x201c;Seems poetic, since she&#x2019;d been bought there. How&#x2019;d she die?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the next problem. I want you to see for yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>As they crossed the room, each took out a slim container, sprayed their hands front and back to seal in oils and fingerprints. At the doorway, Eve sprayed the bottom of her boots to slicken them so that she would pick up no fibers, stray hairs, or skin.</p><p>Eve was already wary. Under normal circumstances there would have been two other investigators on a homicide scene, with recorders for sound and pictures. Forensics would have been waiting with their usual snarly impatience to sweep the scene.</p><p>The fact that only Feeney had been assigned with her meant that there were a lot of eggshells to be walked over.</p><p>&#x201c;Security cameras in the lobby, elevator, and hallways,&#x201d; Eve commented.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already tagged the discs.&#x201d; Feeney opened the bedroom door and let her enter first.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t pretty. Death rarely was a peaceful, religious experience to Eve&#x2019;s mind. It was the nasty end, indifferent to saint and sinner. But this was shocking, like a stage deliberately set to offend.</p><p>The bed was huge, slicked with what appeared to be genuine satin sheets the color of ripe peaches. Small, soft focused spotlights were trained on its center where the naked woman was cupped in the gentle dip of the floating mattress.</p><p>The mattress moved with obscenely graceful undulations to the rhythm of programmed music slipping through the headboard.</p><p>She was beautiful still, a cameo face with a tumbling waterfall of flaming red hair, emerald eyes that stared glassily at the mirrored ceiling, long, milk white limbs that called to mind visions of <i>Swan Lake</i> as the motion of the bed gently rocked them.</p><p>They weren&#x2019;t artistically arranged now, but spread lewdly so that the dead woman formed a final X dead center of the bed.</p><p>There was a hole in her forehead, one in her chest, another horribly gaping between the open thighs. Blood had splattered on the glossy sheets, pooled, dripped, and stained.</p><p>There were splashes of it on the lacquered walls, like lethal paintings scrawled by an evil child.</p><p>So much blood was a rare thing, and she had seen much too much of it the night before to take the scene as calmly as she would have preferred.</p><p>She had to swallow once, hard, and force herself to block out the image of a small child.</p><p>&#x201c;You got the scene on record?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then turn that damn thing off.&#x201d; She let out a breath after Feeney located the controls that silenced the music. The bed flowed to stillness. &#x201c;The wounds,&#x201d; Eve murmured, stepping closer to examine them. &#x201c;Too neat for a knife. Too messy for a laser.&#x201d; A flash came to her&#x2014;old training films, old videos, old viciousness.</p><p>&#x201c;Christ, Feeney, these look like bullet wounds.&#x201d;</p><p>Feeney reached into his pocket and drew out a sealed bag. &#x201c;Whoever did it left a souvenir.&#x201d; He passed the bag to Eve. &#x201c;An antique like this has to go for eight, ten thousand for a legal collection, twice that on the black market.&#x201d;</p><p>Fascinated, Eve turned the sealed revolver over in her hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s heavy,&#x201d; she said half to herself. &#x201c;Bulky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thirty-eight caliber,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;First one I&#x2019;ve seen outside of a museum. This one&#x2019;s a Smith &amp; Wesson, Model Ten, blue steel.&#x201d; He looked at it with some affection. &#x201c;Real classic piece, used to be standard police issue up until the latter part of the twentieth. They stopped making them in about twenty-two, twenty-three, when the gun ban was passed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the history buff.&#x201d; Which explained why he was with her. &#x201c;Looks new.&#x201d; She sniffed through the bag, caught the scent of oil and burning. &#x201c;Somebody took good care of this. Steel fired into flesh,&#x201d; she mused as she passed the bag back to Feeney. &#x201c;Ugly way to die, and the first I&#x2019;ve seen it in my ten years with the department.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Second for me. About fifteen years ago, Lower East Side, party got out of hand. Guy shot five people with a twenty-two before he realized it wasn&#x2019;t a toy. Hell of a mess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fun and games,&#x201d; Eve murmured. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll scan the collectors, see how many we can locate who own one like this. Somebody might have reported a robbery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Might have.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more likely it came through the black market.&#x201d; Eve glanced back at the body. &#x201c;If she&#x2019;s been in the business for a few years, she&#x2019;d have discs, records of her clients, her trick books.&#x201d; She frowned. &#x201c;With Code Five, I&#x2019;ll have to do the door-to-door myself. Not a simple sex crime,&#x201d; she said with a sigh. &#x201c;Whoever did it set it up. The antique weapon, the wounds themselves, almost ruler straight down the body, the lights, the pose. Who called it in, Feeney?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The killer.&#x201d; He waited until her eyes came back to him. &#x201c;From right here. Called the station. See how the bedside unit&#x2019;s aimed at her face? That&#x2019;s what came in. Video, no audio.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s into showmanship.&#x201d; Eve let out a breath. &#x201c;Clever bastard, arrogant, cocky. He had sex with her first. I&#x2019;d bet my badge on it. Then he gets up and does it.&#x201d; She lifted her arm, aiming, lowering it as she counted off, &#x201c;One, two, three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s cold,&#x201d; murmured Feeney.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s cold. He smooths down the sheets after. See how neat they are? He arranges her, spreads her open so nobody can have any doubts as to how she made her living. He does it carefully, practically measuring, so that she&#x2019;s perfectly aligned. Center of the bed, arms and legs equally apart. Doesn&#x2019;t turn off the bed &#x2019;cause it&#x2019;s part of the show. He leaves the gun because he wants us to know right away he&#x2019;s no ordinary man. He&#x2019;s got an ego. He doesn&#x2019;t want to waste time letting the body be discovered eventually. He wants it now. That instant gratification.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was licensed for men and women,&#x201d; Feeney pointed out, but Eve shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a woman. A woman wouldn&#x2019;t have left her looking both beautiful and obscene. No, I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a woman. Let&#x2019;s see what we can find. Have you gone into her computer yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s your case, Dallas. I&#x2019;m only authorized to assist.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See if you can access her client files.&#x201d; Eve went to the dresser and began to carefully search drawers.</p><p>Expensive taste, Eve reflected. There were several items of real silk, the kind no simulation could match. The bottle of scent on the dresser was exclusive, and smelled, after a quick sniff, like expensive sex.</p><p>The contents of the drawers were meticulously ordered, lingerie folded precisely, sweaters arranged according to color and material. The closet was the same.</p><p>Obviously the victim had a love affair with clothes and a taste for the best and took scrupulous care of what she owned.</p><p>And she&#x2019;d died naked.</p><p>&#x201c;Kept good records,&#x201d; Feeney called out. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all here. Her client list, appointments&#x2014;including her required monthly health exam and her weekly trip to the beauty salon. She used the Trident Clinic for the first and Paradise for the second.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Both top of the line.

Each finely constructed volume is an in-depth exploration by a woodworking expert of the title project. Miller's Beds delineates nine projects; Barrett's Bookcases, 11. Both authors explain the basics of woodworking, safety issues, materials lists, cut lists, and measured drawings. And both emphasize process as much as result; the authors each weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the use of certain joints and joinery techniques, for example, and they explain a variety of different designs. Each volume is lavishly illustrated with photographs, line drawings, charts, and the like. The depth of this series makes it more useful than the recent "HomeTime" series.

Visit her at SusanMallery.com.In real life, snow was not nearly as delightful as it appeared in movies and on TV, Noelle Perkins thought as her spinning car finally came to a stop in a snowbank. She'd been driving up the side of the mountain, not making any sudden moves, when it happened. Although she wasn't exactly sure what the <em>it</em> was. There'd been a swoosh and a swerve and then the world twirling around her. There might have been a scream or two, but as she was alone, she wasn't going to admit to that.<br><br>She glanced around, noticing how the nose of her car was firmly planted in the wall of a surprisingly firm drift. The good news was she was pretty close to her destination. The bad news was she was going to have to figure out a way to get down the mountain when it was time to leave.<br><br>That was for later, she told herself as she turned off the engine then unfastened her seat belt. First she had a puppy to let out.<br><br>Noelle opened the door and started to stand, only to discover why her car had gone whirling around. Snow, it seemed, was slippery. Her feet started to go out from under her and she had to grab the door frame to keep from falling.<br><br>"This is so wrong," she murmured, finding her balance and carefully closing the car door. She started walking very tentatively toward the house at the end of the long driveway.<br><br>Snow had come early to Fool's Gold. There had been several inches in late October, then it had all gone away. More had fallen in early November and now this blast the following week. But it was different in town, she thought as she felt her left foot slowly sliding out from under her.<br><br>She waved her arms and managed to stay on her feet, then started forward again. In town, roads were plowed and sidewalks scraped. Someone put magical stuff down so it wasn't slippery. She never had any trouble in town.<br><br>Growing up in Florida, followed by a career move to Los Angeles, had not prepared her for a real winter, she thought as she made it to the porch. Her feet started slipping again. She lunged for the railing and managed to hang on as her lower body slipped and stretched until she was nearly parallel to the ground.<br><br>She dug her toes into the snow and ice, hoping to find some traction. At last she managed to get her legs back under her and straighten. It was like being a cartoon character, she thought grimly. Only with the possibility of breaking bones.<br><br>"This is so not what I expected," she said aloud, thinking that Felicia's request had seemed so reasonable. With everyone running around, Webster, her friend's eight-month-old puppy, had been left home alone. Could Noelle go and let him out?<br><br>Felicia had been a good friend to Noelle. When No-elle had opened her own store&#x2014;The Christmas Attic&#x2014;over Labor Day weekend, Felicia had been right there, helping stock the place and offering suggestions. When Noelle wanted to participate in town advertising with the other local retailers, Felicia had helped her navigate the maze that was local government regulations. When Noelle worried that she would never find a man for...well, you know, let alone love, Felicia had reassured her that it would happen. So helping with the family puppy seemed the least she could do to pay back her friend.<br><br>"I am capable," Noelle told herself as she made it up the stairs. They were surprisingly not slippery. Whatever that magic stuff was, they must use it here, she thought.<br><br>She walked to planters on the railing and felt around for the spare key. Only there wasn't one. She checked all the planters, sure that was where Felicia had told her to look.<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Unsure what to do next, she walked to the front door and heard a soft snuffling sound.<br><br>"Hey, Webster," she called.<br><br>The puppy yipped excitedly.<br><br>Noelle reached for the door handle and found it turned easily. She pushed it open.<br><br>Two things happened at once. A very excited fifty-pound German shepherd puppy bounded out toward her and she saw a duffel bag in the foyer.<br><br>Noelle automatically patted the enthusiastic dog. He licked her hands and wiggled before dashing down the stairs and heading for the trees on the side to take care of business.<br><br>"It's slippery," she called after him, only to realize he had magical feet because he returned at the same hyperspeed with which he'd left and never skidded once.<br><br>"Good boy," she said, hugging him.<br><br>Problem one solved, she thought. Which only left the mysterious duffel and the open front door.<br><br>The bag could be Carter's, she thought, picturing Gideon's thirteen-year-old son. Or it could be the proof that some evildoer had broken into the house and was, even as she stood there, ransacking the place. Either way, she had to find out.<br><br>She stepped cautiously inside, the eager dog at her side. By the front door was an umbrella stand. She grabbed the biggest, most threatening umbrella she saw and held it in her hands like a club. She was tough, she told herself. After all, she'd taken a self-defense class earlier that fall. Of course her instructor had warned them all against walking <em>toward</em> trouble.<br><br>"If you're in here to steal stuff, I've called the police and I'm heavily armed," she yelled as she walked through the open area of the main floor. There was a big living room and a huge kitchen. She knew there were bedrooms at each end of the house and more living space downstairs.<br><br>Webster enjoyed the game, staying at her side, his wagging tail thumping against the wall at regular intervals.<br><br>"Just walk out with your hands up and no one will get hurt," she continued.<br><br>She paused, listening. There was a sound from the hallway. She turned, umbrella poised. If necessary, she would hit the guy, then run. She was pretty sure Webster would run with her, thinking this was just more happy puppy fun.<br><br>The bathroom door opened and a guy stepped out. A tall guy wearing nothing but jeans. He had a towel in one hand and was using it to rub his just washed hair. In fact, staring at the tall, well-muscled man, Noelle would guess he'd just washed the rest of himself, too.<br><br>She paused in the middle of the hallway as several thoughts moved through her brain. First, few burglars bothered to shower while on the job. She didn't have actual working knowledge of that as fact, but was willing to assume it was true. Second, while she knew she'd never seen the man before, something about him was familiar. Third, he was really handsome, with light brown hair and dark blue eyes. And had she already mentioned the body to her brain? Because it was good, too.<br><br>They stared at each other and she remembered her list. Right. Fourth... Her gaze dropped and she swallowed. He had a nasty-looking cut on his left hand&#x2014;complete with raw flesh, black thread from stitches and&#x2014;<br><br>"Oh, no," she whispered as the edges of her consciousness seemed to fold in on herself. "Not blood. Anything but blood."<br><br>For someone who had been through what she had, it was pretty funny that the sight of blood made her woozy, but there it was. Life with a sense of humor. Her stomach roiled, her skin got clammy and she knew she was about an eighth of a second from crumpling to her knees. If that happened, she didn't think Webster was up to saving her.<br><br>She bent down to shorten the distance to the floor and hopefully save herself from a lasting brain injury.<br><br>Gabriel Boylan stared at the half-collapsed blonde. "This is why I hate the suburbs," he told her as he dropped his towel and moved toward her.<br><br>"Can you hear me?" he asked, speaking loudly.<br><br>She waved toward his hand. "Keep that away from me."<br><br>Her voice was weak and she seemed to be swaying. He swore under his breath, noticing even as she started to go down that she was still brandishing that ridiculous umbrella in his direction. Great. His brother had fallen for someone insane.<br><br>He grabbed the umbrella and twisted it out of her grip, then lowered her the rest of the way to the floor. She groaned. He took in her paleness and rapid breathing and figured she was close to fainting.<br><br>The annoyed, I-really-don't-like-people side of him wanted to let it happen. At least unconscious she would be less trouble. But the doctor in him knew that wasn't the right decision. He shifted her so she was on her knees, then pushed her head down.<br><br>"Head lower than the heart," he told her. "Slow your breathing. You're fine."<br><br>"You can't know that," she managed to say.<br><br>"Want to bet?"<br><br>When it seemed like she was going to stay conscious, he returned to the bathroom and quickly wrapped his left hand. The deep cut was still tender and oozing. He was lucky&#x2014;he'd been stupid to get injured in the first place, but while it was ugly, no permanent damage had been done. A good thing considering he needed his hands to make a living.<br><br>When the tape was secure, he shrugged into a clean, long-sleeved T-shirt, then walked back into the hallway.<br><br>The woman had straightened and was staring up at him. Her gaze dropped to his hand, then darted away.<br><br>"Thank you for covering up," she said, her voice low.<br><br>He assumed she meant the wound and not his chest. "You're welcome."<br><br>The puppy settled next to her, leaning heavily on her, ready for the next round of whatever it was they were playing.<br><br>"You're sensitive to blood," Gabriel said.<br><br>The woman winced. "I know. It's ridiculous. I always have been. You'd think I would get over it, but no. Oddly, I can deal with getting a shot, as long as there's no bleeding. Otherwise, I have to close my eyes." She drew in a breath, then looked at him. "Who are you?"<br><br>Gabriel frowned. "Gideon didn't tell you?"<br><br>"I haven't talked to him recently." She paused, as if trying to remember how long it had been. "I guess I've seen him in town but we haven't spoken."<br><br>Now Gabriel was confused. "You're not Felicia?"<br><br>The woman scrambled to her feet. She was a tall blonde&#x2014;too skinny for his taste, but pretty enough. She wore black jeans and a ridiculous sweater decorated with tiny Santa heads. Like he'd said before&#x2014;the suburbs sucked.<br><br>"No, I'm Noelle," she said. "Who are you?"<br><br>"Gabriel."<br><br>He was going to say more but her blue eyes widened. "Gideon's brother?"<br><br>He nodded, unable to figure out why someone he'd never heard of was chasing people with an umbrella in his brother's house. Not that there was an appropriate place for that sort of thing.<br><br>She smiled. Whatever else he was going to grumble about faded as her mouth curved. Because the second she smiled, he felt a whole lot better about nearly everything. His hand hurt less, he wasn't as tired and the avalanche of regret he felt at showing up in Fool's Gold reduced itself to a small rock-slide.<br><br>Talk about a trick.<br><br>The smile widened. "Oh, wow. I didn't know you were coming for sure. You're the doctor, right? Felicia mentioned she'd asked you to stay for the holidays, but I thought you'd said you couldn't make it. I'm Noelle Perkins. Felicia and I are friends. I have a store in town and I know Gideon, of course. And Carter."<br><br>The son his brother hadn't known he had, Gabriel thought. There was a situation.<br><br>"Gideon and Carter are shopping in Sacramento. Felicia got stuck in town and asked me to come and let Webster out." Her smile faded. "Oh, no. I attacked you. I'm really sorry."<br><br>"It's okay," he told her. Mostly because it was and partially because he wanted to see the smile again.<br><br>"I couldn't figure out why the door was open and the spare key wasn't where she'd said."<br><br>"Gideon told me about the key, too, and I used it."<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>The smile returned and his breathing relaxed.<br><br>She bent down and collected the umbrella. "I took a self-defense course a few weeks ago. Just a Saturday afternoon of basic stuff. My instructor would so kill me if she knew what I'd done, so if you could not say anything I'd appreciate it."<br><br>"Not a problem."<br><br>She glanced quickly at the bandage, then away. "Um, what happened to your palm?"<br><br>"I was an idiot."<br><br>"It happens to all of us."<br><br>"I should know better."<br><br>She flashed the smile again. "And the rest of us shouldn't?"<br><br>"Fair point," he told her.<br><br>She waved the umbrella. "I'll put this back." She started down the hall. "Do you want some coffee?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>She went into the kitchen and pulled out mugs and two small pods filled with coffee as if she knew her way around the place.<br><br>He was still having trouble wrapping his mind around the fact that his brother was engaged and had a son. Not that the two events were related. Carter's mother had died a couple of years ago. As for Felicia... Gabriel frowned as he realized he didn't know how she and his brother had met. The fact that he hadn't spoken to anyone in his family in over a year might have something to do with that.<br><br>Webster followed Noelle and looked hopeful as she collected spoons and started the coffeemaker. She eyed him.<br><br>"I'm pretty sure you've already been fed," she told the dog.<br><br>He wagged his tail.<br><br>She sighed. "You're so demanding. Fine. I'll give you a cookie."<br><br>Webster woofed at the word and followed her to the pantry, where a plastic container of bone-shaped treats sat on a shelf.<br><br>"But just one," she told him, waiting until he sat to give it to him.<br><br>He took it gently and bolted from the room.<br><br>Gabriel watched him go. "He's not much of a guard dog. He let me in without a growl."<br><br>"He's a puppy," Noelle said. "Felicia wants him to be friendly rather than aggressive. He's supposed to be Carter's dog, but she's the one who takes care of him. He's been to a few obedience classes but they don't seem to be taking."<br><br>She motioned to the large table, and he moved forward to take a seat. Noelle added the first pod and pushed the button, making sure the mug was positioned underneath.<br><br>She leaned against the counter. "So, you're here for the holidays. To be with your family. That's nice."<br><br>"I haven't seen them in a while," he admitted, trying to remember the last time he'd joined his parents and brother for Christmas. More than a decade, he thought. Fifteen years? Longer than that? Maybe it had been before he'd left for college. "Feel free to fill me in on what I've missed."<br><br>"I've never met your parents," she said cheerfully. "I know Gideon, of course. He moved here before me. It was last year. I just got here in the spring." She wrinkled her nose. "It was before the whole snow thing. I'm going to have to take some lessons or something. It's a lot more slippery than I realized. I know there's an ice element, but I didn't think it was, you know...<em>ice."</em> She made air quotes as she spoke the last word.<br><br>He chuckled. "You have a lot to look forward to."<br><br>"You mean aside from warmer weather?" She turned back to the coffeemaker and pulled out the mug. "How do you like it?" she asked, already moving to the refrigerator.<br><br>"Black is fine."<br><br>"That's such a guy thing."<br><br>She pulled out a container of flavored coffee creamer, then handed him his mug and returned to the counter. She obviously knew her way around the kitchen. Because of Felicia, he told himself. Women who were friends hung out a lot doing stuff like having coffee. He supposed it wasn't that different from going out and having a drink.</p><h2>Shaman of Oberstdorf: Chonrad Stoeckhlin and the Phantoms of the Night (Studies in Early Modern German History)</h2><p><p><i>Shaman of Oberstdorf</i> tells the fascinating story of a sixteenth-century mountain village caught in a panic of its own making. Four hundred years ago the Bavarian alpine town of Oberstdorf, surrounded by the towering peaks of the Vorarlberg, was awash in legends and rumors of prophets and healers, of spirits and specters, of witches and soothsayers. The book focuses on the life of a horse wrangler named Chonrad Stoeckhlin [1549&#x2013;1587], whose extraordinary visions of the afterlife and enthusiastic practice of the occult eventually led to his death&#x2015;and to the death of a number of village women&#x2015;for crimes of witchcraft.</p><p>In addition to recounting Stoeckhlin's tale, this book examines the larger world of alpine myths concerning ghosts and other spirits of the night, documenting how these myths have been abused by German political movements over the years. As an introduction to modern German witchcraft research, as a study of the local impact of the Counter Reformation, and as a historical investigation into popular culture, Behringer's book has the advantage of telling a compelling individual story amidst larger discussions of peasant raptures, magical healing, and unfamiliar alpine notions such as the "furious army," the "wild hunt," popular bonfire festivals, and eerie echoes of pagan Wotan.</p><p>Wolfgang Behringer is one of the premier historians of German witchcraft, not only because of his mastery of the subject at the regional level, but because he also writes movingly, forcefully, and with an eye for the telling anecdote. Reminiscent of such classics as <i>The Cheese and the Worms</i> and <i>The Return of Martin Guerre</i>, <i>Shaman of Oberstdorf</i> is an unforgettable look at early modern German folklore and culture.</p></p><p><p>Wolfgang Behringer teaches at the University of Munich and the University of Bonn and is the author of numerous books on German history and witchcraft.</p><p>H.C.

The Trench Poets, as they came to be called, were soldier-poets dispatching their verse from the front lines.

Memoir. Asian American Studies. Native American Studies. INTIMATE is a hybrid memoir and &#34;photo album&#34; that blends personal essay, historical documentary, and poetry to examine the tense relationship between self, society, and familial legacy in contemporary America. Typographically innovative, INTIMATE creates parallel streams, narrating the stories of Rekdal&#39;s Norwegian-American father and his mixed-race marriage, the photographer Edward S. Curtis, and Curtis&#39;s murdered Apsaroke guide, Alexander Upshaw. The result is panoramic, a completely original literary encounter with intimacy, identity, family relations, and race.</p><p>Paisley Rekdal is the author of a book of essays, <em>The Night My Mother Met Bruce Lee</em> (Pantheon, 2000; Vintage, 2002), and three books of poetry. Her work has received a Village Voice Writers on the Verge Award, a Fulbright Fellowship, and the Amy Lowell Poetry Traveling Fellowship. Her poems and essays have been featured in <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>, NPR, and <em>Nerve</em>, and in many literary journals. She teaches at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City."In this daring lyric fusion of memoir and fictive biography, history and cultural commentary, Paisley Rekdal illuminates the dangerous slippage between transgression and reverence. Identity is forever unfixed by desire. The lush sensuality of her language, lit by dazzling evocations of the Edward Curtis photographs, lure the reader/viewer/voyeur into the borderlands where tempting lies and mythic images entice us to believe these haunting dreams might still be real. For Rekdal, the shimmering gold-tone photographs frosted and fissured by light become a mirror and a window. Through her tender, imaginative, fiercely honest gaze, she exposes the man behind the camera, the beauty of his subjects, the mysterious devotion of his Apsaroke guide, and the eerie resonance all these figures share with her own remarkable life as the daughter of a Chinese mother and Norwegian father." --<i> Melanie Rae Thon</i><p> "<i>Intimate</i>'s refusal of easy classification ... insists that we reconsider not only who shapes American history but how we shape American identity.... [N]ot only a smart and nuanced book but one that is generous and compassionate." --<i> Victoria Redel</i> --Advance Praise</p></p><h2>Cozy Modern Quilts: 23 Easy Pieced Projects to Bust Your Stash</h2><p>Modern doesn&#39;t have to be hard-edged.

So when he enlists as a stretcher bearer in World War I, his gentle way with those animals soon leads him to his calling. Braving bullets and bombs on the battlefields of Gallipoli, Jack brings a donkey to the aid of 300 Allied soldiers &#x2014; earning both man and donkey a beloved spot in legend. This engaging nonfiction tale includes a map and brief bios of key characters.<br>Back matter includes further information.</p><p>Mark Greenwood and Frane Lessac are a husband-and-wife team living in Australia. Mark Greenwood is an award-winning children&#39;s author. Frane Lessac, the author-illustrator of ISLAND COUNTING 1 2 3, has illustrated numerous award-winning books.Grade 3&#x2013;5&#x2014;Following the twists and turns of fate that brought World War I stretcher bearer Jack Simpson back into contact with a wounded childhood friend, this story attempts to pack too much information into a telling that is too simple. There are several hooks to attract readers' attention: Jack's adventurous nature, the drama of war, his coincidental reunion with Billy, and the role of Jack's donkey in rescuing wounded soldiers. However, with so many threads to follow, the story lacks focus. Complex historical events are pared down so much that they become nearly meaningless: How are children to understand why English Jack, who has been working in Australia, enlists because of the war with Germany, sails to Egypt, and ends up in Turkey? The folksy gouache paintings are colorful, dramatic, and detailed, and help to make the story's action more understandable. However, their sweet, cartoony style may limit the book to younger readers, while the story might be better appreciated by older readers who have studied World War I. Perhaps the most interesting information is in the back matter, where more straightforward explanations are provided about donkeys, mascots, Billy, and the respectful relationship between the Turks and their enemies.&#x2014;<i>Heidi Estrin, Feldman Children's Library at Congregation B'nai Israel, Boca Raton, FL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A historical novel, <i>Encounters Unforeseen: 1492 Retold </i>now dramatizes these events from a bicultural perspective, fictionalizing the beliefs, thoughts, and actions of the Native Americans who met Columbus side by side with those of Columbus and other Europeans, all based on a close reading of Columbus's Journal, other primary sources, and anthropological studies.<br>The drama alternates among three Taino chieftains--Caonabo, Guacanagari, and Guarionex--and a Taino youth Columbus captures, Spain's Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, and Columbus himself. It depicts the education, loves and marriages, and other life experiences each brought to the unforeseen encounters and then their astonishment, fears, and objectives in 1492 and 1493. The focus includes the Taino "discovery" of Europe, when Columbus hauls the captive and other Tainos back to Spain, as well as the chieftains' reactions to the abusive garrison of seamen Columbus leaves behind in the Caribbean. Throughout, the Taino protagonists are neither merely victims nor statistics, but personalities and actors comparable to the European, and their side of the story is forcefully told.<br>The novel weaves a fascinating tapestry of scenes and dialogues from the historical record, often incorporating text from primary sources. Isabella plots her dynastic marriage, argues with Ferdinand over who's supreme, and wages war to expand their kingdoms. The chieftains take multiple wives to consolidate their rules, vie to marry the beautiful Anacaona, and battle Caribe raiders. An unknown Columbus conceives a fanciful voyage, marries advantageously to promote it, and yet suffers an agonizing decade of ridicule and rejection. Guacanagari rescues Columbus when the Santa Maria sinks, but Caonabo questions Guacanagari's generosity, and Guarionex is vexed, having witnessed a religious prophecy of Taino genocide inflicted by a "clothed people." Columbus teaches his captive Christianity, initiating the following centuries' collision of Christianity with Native American religions and spirits. The result is a gripping, personal, documented, and bicultural portrayal of the voyage that reshaped the course of world history, written at its 525th anniversary.<br>The Taino stories depict both events known to have occurred (e.g., the chieftains' ascensions to power, the prophecy of genocide, the captive's baptism in Spain) and known practices or experiences (e.g., inter-island canoe travel, a hurricane, a Caribe wife raid, a batey game). The Isabella and Ferdinand stories include their establishment of the Inquisition, subjugation and Christianization of the Canary Islands, completion of the Reconquista, and expulsion of the Jews from Spain, illustrating European doctrines of conquest, enslavement, and involuntary conversion and how the sovereigns ruled over Old World peoples before encountering Native Americans. The Columbus stories portray his pre-1492 sailing experiences and the evolution of his world outlook, and his thoughts during the encounters embody the concepts underlying the European subjugation of Native Americans over the following centuries. Stark societal differences are illustrated, with the Europeans practicing slavery and the Tainos sharing food as communal property. The&nbsp;Sources section briefly discusses interpretations of historians, anthropologists, and others contrary to the author's presentation, as well as issues of academic disagreement.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrew Rowen is a U.C. Berkeley and Harvard Law graduate who practiced law as a partner of a major New York City law firm for almost 30 years prior to retiring to write <i>Encounters Unforeseen</i>. He has devoted six years to researching the underlying historical record and visiting nearly all the Caribbean, European, and Atlantic locations where the action takes place, including the archaeological sites where the Taino chieftains lived in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. He has long been interested in the roots of religious intolerance. He lives in New York City with his wife and three kids."Rowen's research...is nothing less than breathtaking. The sensitivity and originality of his portrayals are equally impressive, avoiding the trap of simply retelling a familiar tale from an exclusively European perspective or casting the explorers as nothing more than rapacious colonialists....intelligently captures the religious impulse behind Columbus' adventure...remarkably new and inventive..."--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"...a phenomenal historical novel...spellbinding...Few authors recreate historical worlds and craft characters who feel so real...I particularly enjoyed the way the soul of the Native Americans comes across the narrative. The characters are intriguing, each reflecting a rich culture and a historical background that will excite the reader."--<i>Readers' Favorite </i>Five Star Review<br><br>"An impressively crafted work of riveting fiction from beginning to end, author Andrew Rowen has firmly grounded his truly exceptional novel in historical fact.

The lives, loves, victories and defeats of the Ta�no Indians are just as meticulously and poignantly brought to life as Columbus, his famous voyage and Queen Isabella's court. A sprawling, globe-trotting, all-consuming tour de force illuminating all sides of the epic cultural clash that created the New World."--Trey Ellis, <i>Platitudes, Home Repairs, Right Here, Right Now</i><br><br>"An extraordinary combination of scholarship and imagination, Andrew Rowen's <i>Encounters Unforeseen </i>creates a balanced 15th century world, where Caribbean natives and European explorers meet in a painfully evolving historical adventure."--Bartle Bull, <i>The White Rhino Hotel</i>, <i>A Cafe on the Nile</i>.<br><br>"The story of Europe's first encounters with the Americas has become so fraught and tortured that most people now avoid it, which is a shame, because it is so historically important. With <i>Encounters Unforeseen</i>, this fascinating story becomes human and real. Andrew Rowen has produced a remarkable work - beautifully written, well researched and necessary. A landmark!"--Warren Kozak, <i>LeMay: The Life and Wars of General Curtis LeMay</i></p><h2>Horns, Strings, and Harmony (Dover Books On Music: Acoustics)</h2><p><p>"A fascinating excursion into an area too often ignored by the musical practitioner." &#x2014; <i>Music Library Association Notes.<br></i>If you've ever wondered how a musical instrument produces the sound it does, this book explains the physics of musical instruments in an engaging and understandable way. Dr. Benade was a nuclear physicist, flutist, and science educator with a special ability to explain complex ideas in a simple, straightforward manner. In this book he brings that ability to bear in elucidating the ways in which music is formed by many different kinds of musical instruments.<br>Dr. Benade first explores simple and complex vibrating systems and the ear's reception of sound. He then describes the fundamentals of the piano, violin, trumpet, bugle, trombone, oboe, clarinet, flute, saxophone, and many other instruments, demonstrating the sound-making capacities of each. For mechanically inclined readers who are interested in constructing basic instrumental models, Dr. Benade demonstrates how to build a working trumpet, flute, and clarinet.<br>Enhanced with clear diagrams and easy scientific models, <i>Horns, Strings, and Harmony</i> is a book that will increase the musical enjoyment and understanding of all musicians, music lovers, and amateur scientists.<br>"The book is commended not only to the 'young person' who seeks to know some physics of musical instruments but also to those who would like to review in simple outline the basic physics of what happens within a musical instrument." <i>&#x2014; Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.</i></p><p></p></p><p><p><b>The Science of Sound <br></b>Arthur H. Benade developed his interest in the acoustics of musical instruments growing up in Lahore (British India, now Pakistan) where his father was an educator. His interest in acoustics continued to grow as he earned a PhD in Physics at Washington University in St. Louis and joined the faculty of Case Institute of Technology, now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, as a nuclear physicist. </p><p> </p><p>The turning point came when the Physical Science Study Committee commissioned him to write the influential concise text, <i>Horns, Strings and Harmony, </i>which Anchor Books launched as a mass market&#x2013;sized paperback in 1960 and which Dover reprinted in 1992. Known to have inspired generations of teachers, this clear and thoughtful study has sold more than 150,000 copies in all editions and has been translated into several languages. In the decade following the appearance of <i>Horns, Strings and Harmony,</i> Benade completed his more extensive text, <i>Fundamentals of Musical Acoustics,</i> first published by Oxford University Press in 1976 and reprinted by Dover in 1996. </p><p> </p><p>In addition to his two books, Benade wrote more than 100 technical papers, contributed to many symposia, and lectured on acoustics all over the world.

Yet all the while he plans a fitting revenge - eagerly awaiting the time when his sensuous captor becomes his helpless captive. . .and is made to suffer the same rapturous torment and exquisite ecstasy that he himself has endured. </p></p><p><p>One of the world's most successful authors of historical romance, every one of Johanna Lindsey's previous novels has been a national bestseller, and several of her titles have reached the #1 spot on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list. Ms. Lindsey lives in New England with her family.</p>Lindsey, the author of nearly 40 romance novels, is back with a vintage cloth edition of this book (originally published in 1991), which proves that a well-written romance novel never goes out of style. The year is 1152 and, as a woman, Lady Rowena Belleme has no rights. Her evil stepbrother, Gilbert d'Ambray, desires control over as much English land as possible and has pledged Rowena's hand to Lyons of Kirkburough-a man so near death he is a walking corpse. Rowena at first refuses, but Gilbert threatens to kill Rowena's mother if she does not comply. Before the marriage can be consummated, Lyons dies and Rowena celebrates her good fortune, until Gilbert arrives with a new plot-Rowena must become pregnant before Lyons's death is announced. For three nights, Rowena lies with a handsome stranger kidnapped by Gilbert's men. Ashamed at the mistreatment of the man and knowing that Gilbert plans to kill him, Rowena helps him escape. Soon after, Kirkburough is attacked by Gilbert's nemesis Lord Fulkhurst. Rowena is captured and taken to the Fulkhurst dungeon, where Lord Warrick de Chaville cruelly strips Rowena of her title and forces her to become his serf. Despite their passionate hatred of one another, a fervor smolders between them, igniting passion of another kind. Warrick, always feared by the fairer sex, is intrigued by Rowena, who is not afraid of him. Rowena, accustomed to men using her for their own gain, is astonished that Warrick truly cares about her. But will their newfound love be enough to overcome Gilbert's vengeful wrath? Rowena and Gilbert are splendid protagonists, humorously stubborn and pleasingly forthright. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>On God</h2><p><p><em>On God</em> contemplates our search for the sacred.

The origins of gem healing can be traced to the earliest Sanskrit scriptures, in which gems are valued for their ability to absorb and transmit vital life forces. Ayurvedic healers, Indian astrologers, and Tantric alchemists all made use of gem formulas in their various practices. The author describes these in vivid detail as well as the attributes and powers of the sun and planets according to Hindu astrology and legend as they relate specifically to the use of gems. Here they play a critical role in enhancing the positive power of the planets and reducing their negative influence. Charts are included that determine the appropriate gems to be worn according to one&#x2019;s astrological sun sign and ascendant.

The dramatic reduction of livestock on the Navajo Reservation in the 1930s &#x2015; when hundreds of thousands of sheep, goats, and horses were killed &#x2015; was an ambitious attempt by the federal government to eliminate overgrazing on an arid landscape and to better the lives of the people who lived there. Instead, the policy was a disaster, resulting in the loss of livelihood for Navajos &#x2015; especially women, the primary owners and tenders of the animals &#x2015; without significant improvement of the grazing lands.<br><br>Livestock on the reservation increased exponentially after the late 1860s as more and more people and animals, hemmed in on all sides by Anglo and Hispanic ranchers, tried to feed themselves on an increasingly barren landscape. At the beginning of the twentieth century, grazing lands were showing signs of distress. As soil conditions worsened, weeds unpalatable for livestock pushed out nutritious native grasses, until by the 1930s federal officials believed conditions had reached a critical point. Well-intentioned New Dealers made serious errors in anticipating the human and environmental consequences of removing or killing tens of thousands of animals.<br><br>Environmental historian Marsha Weisiger examines the factors that led to the poor condition of the range and explains how the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Navajos, and climate change contributed to it. Using archival sources and oral accounts, she describes the importance of land and stock animals in Navajo culture. By positioning women at the center of the story, she demonstrates the place they hold as significant actors in Native American and environmental history.<br><br><i>Dreaming of Sheep in Navajo Country</i> is a compelling and important story that looks at the people and conditions that contributed to a botched policy whose legacy is still felt by the Navajos and their lands today.</p><p><p>A fresh interpretation of the history of Navajo pastoralism. Chronicles the government's 1930s botched policy to preserve grazing lands by eradicating livestock on the Navajo reservation--with particular focus on women, the primary owners and tenders of the animals.</p>"<i>Dreaming of Sheep in Navajo Country</i> ultimately presents a tragedy that could have been largely avoided. In this important book, Marsha Weisiger leaves us with an enhanced appreciation of victories and victims. She portrays resilient people who will do all they can to remain on the land and a persisting sadness nourished by dreams of a time gone by and a world to which sheep are unlikely to return." - Peter Iverson, Regents Professor of History, Arizona State University</p><h2>W, or the Memory of Childhood (Verba Mundi (Paperback))</h2><p>From the author of Life: A User's Manual (Godine, 1987) comes an equally astonishing novel: W or The Memory of Childhood, a narrative that reflects a great writer's effort to come to terms with his childhood and his part in the Nazi occupation of France.<br><br>Guaranteed to send shock waves through the literary community, Perec's W tells two parallel stories. The first is autobiographical, describing the author's wartime boyhood. The second tale, denser, more disturbing, more horrifying, is the allegorical story of W, a mythical island off Tierra del Fuego governed by the thrall of the Olympic "ideal," where losers are tortured and winners held in temporary idolatry.<br><br>As the reader soon discovers, W is a place where "it is more important to be lucky than to be deserving," and "you have to fight to live...[with] no recourse, no mercy, no salvation, not even any hope that time will sort things out." Here, sport is glorified and victors honored, but athletes are vilified, losers executed, rape common, stealing encouraged and violence a fact of life.<br><br>Perec's interpretive vision of the Holocaust forces us to ask the question central to our time: How did this happen before our eyes? How did we look at those "shells of skin and bone, ashen faced, with their backs permanently bent, their eyes full of panic and their suppurating sores"? How did this happen, not on W, but before millions of spectators, some horrified, some cheering, some indifferent, but all present at the games watching the events of that grisly arena?<br><br>This book, a devastating indictment of passivity and the psychology of crowds, will find its place beside such great works as Milan Kundera's The Book of Laughter and Forgetting and Primo Levi's The Periodic Table and If Not Now, When?</p><p>Georges Perec (1936-82) won the Prix Renaudot in 1965 for his first novel Things: A Story of the Sixties, and went on to exercise his unrivalled mastery of language in almost every imaginable kind of writing, from the apparently trivial to the deeply personal. He composed acrostics, anagrams, autobiography, criticism, crosswords, descriptions of dreams, film scripts, heterograms, lipograms, memories, palindromes, plays, poetry, radio plays, recipes, riddles, stories short and long, travel notes, univocalics, and, of course, novels. Life: A User&#39;s Manual, which draws on many of Perec&#39;s other works, appeared in 1978 after nine years in the making and was acclaimed a masterpiece to put beside Joyce&#39;s Ulysses. It won the Prix Medicis and established Perec&#39;s international reputation.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Infallible Word: A Symposium by the Members of the Faculty of Westminster Theological Seminary</h2><p>A symposium by the members of the faculty of Westminster Theological Seminary&#x2014;Murray, Young, Stonehouse, Skilton, Woolley, Kuiper, and Van Til&#x2014;on Scripture's attestation, authority, transmission, and relevancy; scriptural preaching; and Scripture and nature.</p><p>"[One of] the two most helpful books on biblical authority. . . . an excellent series of Reformed essays." --<b>Joel R.

To the popular imagination, she is the archetypal warrior queen, a Medieval Boudicca, renowned for her heroic struggle against the Danes and her independent rule of the Saxon Kingdom of Mercia. In fiction, however, she has also been cast as the mistreated wife who seeks a Viking lover, and struggles to be accepted as a female ruler in a patriarchal society. The sources from her own time, and later, reveal a more complex, nuanced and fascinating image of the &#x2018;Lady of the Mercians&#x2019;. A skilled diplomat who forged alliances with neighbouring territories, she was a shrewd and even ruthless leader willing to resort to deception and force to maintain her power. Yet she was also a patron of learning, who used poetic tradition and written history to shape her reputation as a Christian maiden engaged in an epic struggle against the heathen foe. The real �thelfl�d emerges as a remarkable political and military leader, admired in her own time, and a model of female leadership for writers of later generations.</p><p>Joanna Arman is currently a PhD Student at the University of Winchester, researching Women and Feudalism in the Late Middle-Ages.

It's a miracle that the little girl dressed in rags and abandoned in the sand is still breathing when an old miner discovers her. Even more so that he is able to keep her alive long enough to bring her to the town from which she'll take her name: Leonora. Sent to an orphanage, mute with grief and fear, Leonora slowly bonds with another orphan, James, who fights to protect her until both are sent away--Leonora to a wealthy American family, James to relatives who have emigrated from Ireland to claim him. <br><br>Years later, Leonora is given a chance to return to her beloved Australia. There, in Wanjarri Downs, she will again come face to face with James, who's grown from a reticent boy into a strong, resourceful man.

Yet ever since the discovery of these hieroglyphs in 1881, they have been misconstrued by Western Egyptologists as a garbled collection of primitive myths and incantations, relegating to obscurity their radiant fusion of philosophy, scientific inquiry, and religion.</p><p> Now, in a seminal work, the classicist and linguist Susan Brind Morrow has recast the Pyramid Texts as a coherent work of art, arguing that they should be recognized as a formative event in the evolution of human thought. In <i>The Dawning Moon of the Mind</i> she explains how to read hieroglyphs, contextualizes their evocative imagery, and interprets the entire poem. The result is a magisterial religious and philosophical text revealing a profound consciousness of the world with astonishing parallels to Judeo-Christian culture, Buddhism, and Tantra.</p><p> More than twenty years in the making, <i>The Dawning Moon of the Mind</i> is a monumental achievement that locates one of the origins of poetic thought in Western culture. Almost before science, art, and written language, these texts set forth the relationship between time and eternity, life and death, history and ideas. In <i>The Dawning Moon of the Mind</i>they emerge in their original luminosity and intelligence alongside a persuasive argument for their central importance to the history of language.</p></p><p><b>Susan Brind Morrow</b> studied classics, Arabic, and Egyptology at Columbia University.

Artefact</p><h2>The Moral Fool: A Case for Amorality</h2><p>Justice, equality, and righteousness&#x2014;these are some of our greatest moral convictions. Yet in times of social conflict, morals can become rigid, making religious war, ethnic cleansing, and political purges possible. Morality, therefore, can be viewed as pathology-a rhetorical, psychological, and social tool that is used and abused as a weapon. <br><br>An expert on Eastern philosophies and social systems theory, Hans-Georg Moeller questions the perceived goodness of morality and those who claim morality is inherently positive. Critiquing the ethical "fanaticism" of Western moralists, such as Immanuel Kant, Lawrence Kohlberg, John Rawls, and the utilitarians, Moeller points to the absurd fundamentalisms and impracticable prescriptions arising from definitions of good. Instead he advances a theory of "moral foolishness," or moral asceticism, extracted from the "amoral" philosophers of East Asia and such thinkers as Ludwig Wittgenstein and Niklas Luhmann. The moral fool doesn't understand why ethics are necessarily good, and he isn't convinced that the moral perspective is always positive. In this way he is like most people, and Moeller defends this foolishness against ethical pathologies that support the death penalty, just wars, and even Jerry Springer's crude moral theater. Comparing and contrasting the religious philosophies of Christianity, Daoism, and Zen Buddhism, Moeller presents a persuasive argument in favor of amorality.</p><p>Hans-Georg Moeller is senior lecturer in the Philosophy Department at University College Cork, Ireland. His publications on Daoism and social systems theory include <i>Choice</i> Outstanding Academic Title <i>The Philosophy of the Daodejing</i> as well as a translation of the <i>Daodejing</i>, <i>Daoism Explained: From the Dream of the Butterfly to the Fishnet Allegory</i>, and <i>Luhmann Explained: From Souls to Systems</i>.Moeller shows just how germane and engaging public philosophy can be.

Now she, Karina, and Julianne were escaping the dreary English countryside for a London University hall of residence. Interspersing accounts of her current position as a university student with recollections of her childhood and an ever difficult relationship with her longtime schoolmate Karina, Carmel reflects on a generation of girls desiring the power of men, but fearful of abandoning what is expected and proper. When these bright but confused young women land in late 1960s London, they are confronted with a slew of new preoccupations--sex, politics, food, and fertility--and a pointless grotesque tragedy of their own.</p><p>Hilary Mantel's magnificent novel examines the pressures on women during the early days of contemporary feminism to excel--but not be <i>too</i> successful--in England's complex hierarchy of class and status.</p></p><p>Hilary Mantel's seventh novel examines the pressures on women during the 1960s to excel--but not be <i>too</i> successful--in England's complex hierarchy of class and status. Pushed by a domineering mother, Carmel McBain climbs her way through the pecking order and ends up at London University as an acquiescent and undernourished teenager, achieving the status so desired by her mother, but too weak to make use of it or pose a threat to anyone. Though this is Carmel's story, it reflects on a generation of girls desiring the power of men, but fearful of abandoning what is expected and proper.Carmel McBain is the only child of working-class Irish-Catholic parents. Her mother aspires to something more for her than what life in their depressed mill town has to offer. She is ambitious for her daughter, determined that she slip through England&#39;s rigid social barriers. And so, early on, she pushes Carmel, first to gain a scholarship to the local convent school, then to sit the exams for a place at London University. And Carmel does not disappoint. But success carries with it a fearful price. It sets her on a lonely journey that will take her as far as possible from where she began, uprooting her from the ties of class and place, of family and faith. Uprooting her ultimately from her own self. A coming-of-age novel, a memoir of a Catholic childhood, a piercing and witty look at social pretensions, a story of lost possibilities and girlhood betrayals: perhaps only a novelist of Hilary Mantel&#39;s enormous talents could have taken such material and shaped it into so fresh and arresting a tale.</p><h2>Rumi: Swallowing the Sun</h2><p>A beautifully presented volume that draws from the breadth of the great Persian poet&#x2019;s work<br><br>Timeless and eternal, the poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi is loved the world over.

Which is saying something.&#34;-- &#34;Los Angeles Times&#34;&#34;Hijuelos shows us that miracles are something nearer than we believe.&#34;-- &#34;Denver Post&#34;<p>Hijuelos' novel tells the story of Mr. Ives, who was adopted from a foundling's home as a child. When we first meet him in the 1950s, Mr. Ives is very much a product of his time. He has a successful career in advertising, a wife and two children, and believes he is on his way to pursuing the typical American dream. But the dream is shattered when his son Robert, who is studying for the priesthood, is killed violently at Christmas. Overwhelmed by grief and threatened by a loss of faith in humankind, Mr. Ives begins to question the very foundations of his life. Part love story--of a man for his wife, for his children, for God--and part meditation on how a person can find spiritual peace in the midst of crisis, <em>Mr. Ives' Christmas </em>is a beautifully written, tender and passionate story of a man trying to put his life in perspective. In the expert hands of Oscar Hijuelos, the novel speaks eloquently to the most basic and fulfilling aspects of life for all of us.</p></p><h2>Graffiti and Street Art (World of Art)</h2><p><p><strong>A refreshingly jargon-free survey of what many consider <em>the</em> art movement of the twenty-first century.</strong></p> Whether adored or abhorred, graffiti and street art provoke passionate debate.

Banker, man of letters, inventor of the Treasury bill, and author of <em>Lombard Street</em>, the still-canonical guide to stopping a run on the banks, Bagehot prescribed the doctrines that&#x2015;decades later&#x2015;inspired the radical responses to the world&#x2019;s worst financial crises.</p><p>Born in the small market town of Langport, just after the Panic of 1825 swept across England, Bagehot followed in his father&#x2019;s footsteps and took a position at the local family bank&#x2015;but his influence on financial matters would soon spread far beyond the county of Somerset. Persuasive and precocious, he came to hold sway in political circles, making high-profile friends, including William Gladstone&#x2015;and enemies, such as Lord Overstone and Benjamin Disraeli. As a prolific essayist on wide-ranging topics, Bagehot won the admiration of Matthew Arnold and Woodrow Wilson, and delighted in paradox. He was also a misogynist, and while he opposed slavery, he misjudged Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War. As editor of the <em>Economist</em>, he offered astute commentary on the financial issues of his day, and his name lives on in an eponymous weekly column. He has been called "the Greatest Victorian."</p><p>In James Grant&#x2019;s colorful and groundbreaking biography, Bagehot appears as both an ornament to his own age and a muse to our own. Drawing on a wealth of historical documents, correspondence, and publications, Grant paints a vivid portrait of the banker and his world.</p></p><p>James Grant founded Grant&#x2019;s Interest Rate Observer, a financial markets journal, and authored The Forgotten Depression, which won the Hayek Prize. His writing has appeared in the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Published in 1951, it makes a daring critique of communism, how it had gone wrong behind the Iron Curtain, and the resulting totalitarian regimes. It questions two events held sacred by the left wing, the French Revolution of 1789 and the Russian Revolution of 1917 that had resulted, he believed, in terrorism as a political instrument. In this towering intellectual document, Camus argues that hope for the future lies in revolt, which unlike revolution is a spontaneous response to injustice, and a chance to achieve change without giving up collective and intellectual freedom.</p><p>By one of the most profoundly influential thinkers of our century, The Rebel is a classic essay on revolution. For Albert Camus, the urge to revolt is one of the "essential dimensions" of human nature, manifested in man's timeless Promethean struggle against the conditions of his existence, as well as the popular uprisings against established orders throughout history. And yet, with an eye toward the French Revolution and its regicides and deicides, he shows how inevitably the course of revolution leads to tyranny. As old regimes throughout the world collapse, The Rebel resonates as an ardent, eloquent, and supremely rational voice of conscience for our tumultuous times. <br>Translated from the French by Anthony Bower.By one of the most profoundly influential thinkers of our century, The Rebel is a classic essay on revolution.</p><h2>A Wizard of Mars: The Ninth Book in the Young Wizards Series (9)</h2><p>In the hotly anticipated ninth installment of the Young Wizards series, Kit and Nita become part of an elite team investigating the mysterious &#x201c;message in a bottle,&#x201d; which holds the first clues to the secrets of the long-lost inhabitants of Mars.

But by the year 1900, a new type of lawyer was born, one who understood business as well as the law. Working hand in glove with their clients, over the next two decades these New York City &#x201c;white shoe&#x201d; lawyers devised and implemented legal strategies that would drive the business world throughout the twentieth century. These lawyers were architects of the monopolistic new corporations so despised by many, and acted as guardians who helped the kings of industry fend off government overreaching. Yet they also quietly steered their robber baron clients away from a &#x201c;public be damned&#x201d; attitude toward more enlightened corporate behavior during a period of progressive, turbulent change in America. <br><br> Author John Oller, himself a former Wall Street lawyer, gives us a richly-written glimpse of turn-of-the-century New York, from the grandeur of private mansions and elegant hotels and the city&#x2019;s early skyscrapers and transportation systems, to the depths of its deplorable tenement housing conditions. Some of the biggest names of the era are featured, including business titans J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, lawyer-statesmen Elihu Root and Charles Evans Hughes, and presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. <br><br> Among the colorful, high-powered lawyers vividly portrayed, <i>White Shoe</i> focuses on three: Paul Cravath, who guided his client George Westinghouse in his war against Thomas Edison and launched a new model of law firm management&#x2014;the &#x201c;Cravath system&#x201d;; Frank Stetson, the &#x201c;attorney general&#x201d; for financier J. P. Morgan who fiercely defended against government lawsuits to break up Morgan&#x2019;s business empires; and William Nelson Cromwell, the lawyer &#x201c;who taught the robber barons how to rob,&#x201d; and was best known for his instrumental role in creating the Panama Canal.<br><br> In <i>White Shoe</i>, the story of this small but influential band of Wall Street lawyers who created Big Business is fully told for the first time.</p><p><b>John Oller</b> is a retired white shoe Wall Street lawyer who spent thirty years as an associate and then partner at Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher, one of New York City&#x2019;s most venerable law firms. His books include&nbsp;<i>American Queen: The Rise and Fall of Kate Chase Sprague&#x2014;Civil War &#x201c;Belle of the North&#x201d; and Gilded Age Woman of Scandal</i> and <i>The Swamp Fox: How Francis Marion Saved the American Revolution.</i>&nbsp;He lives in Manhattan.<p>Chapter 1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Boy Wonder</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul Cravath was only twenty-six and barely out of law school when George Westinghouse hired him to take on the world's most famous inventor, Thomas Alva Edison.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, then in his thirties, was already well known for his invention of the railroad air brake and his innovations in railway switching and signaling. Reserved and courteous in public, charmingly blunt in private, he was driven by an idealistic desire to improve the lot of his fellow man. Although a forceful and successful entrepreneur, he disdained financiers and moneymen. He paid his employees beyond the going rate, gave them pensions and days off, and provided a safe working environment. An engineer's engineer, he pursued his work with boundless energy, imagination, and resourcefulness. By the mid-1880s Westinghouse had thrown himself fully into the burgeoning industry of electrical power and was looking forward to a free and fair contest over how best to distribute it to people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Westinghouse's rival in that endeavor was Thomas Edison, the Wizard of Menlo Park and world-renowned inventor of the light bulb and phonograph. Just a few months younger than Westinghouse, Edison cultivated a folksy manner that belied a ruthless win-at-all-costs attitude. A garrulous man who quite enjoyed his celebrity status, Edison had a genius for self-promotion and moneymaking in addition to invention. He resented the intrusion of Westinghouse-a railway engineer-into a field that Edison had pioneered and felt belonged to him alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Westinghouse and Edison faced off in two separate but related disputes: One, the light bulb war, concerned Edison's claim that Westinghouse, among many other competitors, was infringing on his 1879 incandescent light bulb patent. Edison filed hundreds of patent suits against Westinghouse, and Cravath was charged with their defense. The light bulb war would drag on for years because a large part of Westinghouse's strategy, and hence Cravath's job, was to stall for time until Edison's patent expired in 1894.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But while the highly technical patent litigation brought Cravath steady business, it was the second war-the so-called War of (Electric) Currents-that first brought Cravath to public attention. This one was less a legal battle than a full-scale commercial war, fought on many fronts, that pitted Westinghouse's alternating current (AC) transmission system against Edison's direct current (DC) system. The winner would determine how electricity would be delivered to homes and businesses in the coming century-and guarantee billions for its parent company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Westinghouse AC system was based on the innovations of an eccentric genius, Nicola Tesla, the Serbian inventor whose patents Westinghouse licensed. Under this system, alternating current was transmitted at high voltage (1000 to 2000 volts) from a central generating station over very long distances for use in the bright arc lamps that lit city streets, including New York's Great White Way, starting in 1880. At the point of commercial or residential consumption, transformers reduced the current to low voltage (50 watts) to light indoor incandescent lamps and bulbs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By contrast, the Edison DC system ran at 110 volts, which was insufficient to illuminate large outdoor spaces and could not deliver current to consumers more than a mile from each of the many generating plants Edison placed in the middle of dense population centers. But the Edison system had one major perceived advantage: safety. Edison buried his low-voltage lines underground, a costly and labor-intensive exercise that eliminated the risk of electric shock. Westinghouse's high-voltage AC lines, on the other hand, were strung up on utility poles for street lighting, intersecting with thousands of telephone and telegraph wires. In the 1880s, the skylines of New York and other major cities came to resemble a giant spiderweb. Besides their unsightliness, the suspended wires were susceptible to being blown down in a storm and, more ominously, posed a danger of electrocution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In New York alone, dozens of people were killed by live high-voltage AC wires between 1888 and 1890-mainly electrical and other utility workers, but also unsuspecting children who touched downed wires. The outcry over this danger-known as the Electric Wire Panic-created a public relations nightmare for Westinghouse, whose AC lines were often blamed. By recent law, the AC wires were supposed to be buried underground, like Edison's. But due to neglect and lethargy on the part of the company the city hired to dig the conduits, and corruption within the Tammany-dominated board of electrical control, not enough underground conduits had been built to house the lines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cravath spent much of his first few years as Westinghouse's lawyer fending off attempts-many of them instigated or supported by Edison-to cripple or kill the AC system because of the safety issues. Frequently quoted in the newspapers, Cravath would dispute that Westinghouse's lines were the ones at fault, arguing that they were all safely insulated while promising to get them buried underground just as quickly as the city could complete the conduits. While Westinghouse's prior counsel had contested the city's power to compel the company to bury its wires, Cravath offered to have his clients build the conduits themselves if adequately compensated, and Westinghouse was awarded a contract to do so-at least until the courts gave the job back to the original company in a suit brought by Elihu Root.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Injunctions in the War of Currents flew back and forth; no sooner would Cravath obtain a restraining order preventing the city from arbitrarily cutting down his client's overhead wires than the injunction would be dissolved and city workers would take their axes and clippers to the lines. In October 1889, a Western Union lineman named John Feeks was roasted in a network of wires, as the New York Times headline put it, when some dead wires he was trying to cut from a telegraph pole crossed with some AC wires a mile away. As a horrified lunch crowd of pedestrians looked on from below, Feeks literally caught on fire, blue flames shooting from his mouth and nostrils and sparks flying about his feet. His body was so tangled with wires that he was suspended aloft for forty-five minutes, dangling pitiably until his coworkers managed to cut him loose and lower his charred body to the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cravath immediately agreed, on his client's behalf, to turn off the "death currents" until they could be pronounced safe by experts (this resulted in darkening the city streets, which created its own set of problems). Reacting to the crisis, Westinghouse came at once from Pittsburgh to New York and set up quarters in the Hotel Brunswick on Fifth Avenue, where Cravath moved his force of young lawyers and worked day and night and all day on Sundays.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As part of his propaganda war against Westinghouse, Edison had lobbied to have alternating current used in the first execution by electric chair in New York State-ostensibly to institute a more humane form of capital punishment than hanging, but really to associate AC with electrocution in the public's mind. He sponsored experiments in which dogs, calves, and a horse were instantly killed when zapped with as little as 300 to 750 volts of AC, less than half the voltage used in the wires strung above city streets. Although Edison had previously opposed the death penalty, he now urged the use of high-voltage AC to execute convicted murderer William Kemmler. When Bourke Cockran, a high-priced New York lawyer-politician, intervened to try to halt the execution, it was commonly assumed that Westinghouse was behind the effort, and although both he and Cravath denied it, the fact that Cravath often hired Cockran to work with him on litigated matters lent credence to the notion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The execution did go forward in August 1890 but was bungled: Kemmler was declared dead after receiving seventeen seconds of AC charge, but as it turned out he was still alive, requiring another eight agonizing minutes of jolts at 2,000 volts that burned him to death. Cravath told the press this would surely end the electric chair as an execution method because "the mysterious character of electricity itself, about which even experts have much to learn," counseled against "further experiments at the expense of human life." Westinghouse merely quipped that "they would have done better using an axe."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cravath, who was assisted by Charles Evans Hughes, lost almost all the Westinghouse litigation with New York City and with Edison, who was better financed and had better press. But Westinghouse ended up winning the war. As the superiority of his AC system became increasingly apparent, and the safety issues abated, the stubbornly resistant Edison was draining his company's resources by continuing the costly legal battles. In 1892 Edison was ousted from control of the Edison General Electric Company through the machinations of banker J. P. Morgan, by then a large owner of Edison stock. Morgan, represented by Francis Lynde Stetson, engineered a merger with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, which utilized AC power in competition with Westinghouse. Managerial power of the renamed General Electric Company was transferred to the Thomson-Houston group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After Cravath helped a financially bleeding Westinghouse raise enough new money to stave off a bankruptcy proceeding in 1891, Westinghouse went on to demonstrate the advantages of AC power by illuminating the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. Two years later he successfully ran AC power all the way to Buffalo, more than twenty miles from the new Niagara Falls hydroelectric plant, a project initiated some years earlier by Stetson. The War of Currents was over, and AC had won.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1896 Westinghouse and General Electric agreed to cross-license patents and share royalties to end their remaining patent disputes. Cravath became one of the two Westinghouse nominees on the private board of patent control created to supervise the agreement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Westinghouse experience taught Cravath that representation of a corporate client involved neither strictly law nor strictly business, but a mixture of the two. The law needed to be respected but also melded to the client's business and public relations needs. It was said of Cravath that he was "not so much a great lawyer as he was a brilliant business man and promoter endowed with a legal mind."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cravath had left Walter Carter in 1891 to form his own two-partner firm, where he continued his legal work for Westinghouse. In 1892 he married an opera singer from Kalamazoo, Michigan, Agnes Huntington, who had first made her name on the London stage. Depending on which story one believed, she either had considered suing her ex-fianc&#x17d;, a wealthy Philadelphia man, for breach of promise, or had merely asked for her letters back from him before marrying the thirty-one-year-old Cravath. With a shared love of music and theater, the Cravaths would eagerly take part in high society in Manhattan, where they owned an architecturally commissioned town house on East Thirty-Ninth Street in the fashionable Murray Hill district. They were also members of the exclusive horsing set on the North Shore of Long Island-later Great Gatsby country-where they built a series of magnificent estates and became founding members of the legendary Piping Rock Club.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1899 Cravath moved to the Seward firm, then headed by a rising star of the bar named William Dameron Guthrie, a railroad litigator and specialist in constitutional law. Like almost all the white shoe lawyers, who were self-made men, Guthrie became a millionaire by earning his wealth rather than inheriting it. Suave and slender, with a black mustache and buttoned-down look, Guthrie was born to a San Francisco port surveyor and newspaper owner and received his early education in England and France. When his father died, young Guthrie was brought to America and sent to New York City's public schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Guthrie began as a messenger and stenographer with the Seward firm before joining it as a lawyer out of Columbia Law School. He came to prominence by persuading the US Supreme Court to declare the 1894 federal income tax unconstitutional, one of the most important policy-making lawsuits of the era. It would take the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1913, to overrule the Supreme Court's decision and authorize the income tax.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Guthrie was a brilliant lawyer (and workaholic) whose perfectionism caused him great nervous strain. A conservative-indeed reactionary-Republican, he longed for a political career, for which his oratorical skills suited him. Invited by William Tecumseh Sherman to give the leading address on the general's trip to Denver in 1891, Guthrie earned Sherman's approval as well as praise from the Denver papers as "the most eloquent and interesting speaker of the day . . . with commanding presence, a clear voice, and distinct enunciation."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Guthrie, an inconsiderate and contentious man, lacked the personal warmth necessary to run for office; his overwork kept him in a constant state of irritation. A Harper's Weekly profile called him aggressive and "frank to the point of brusqueness." Guthrie would often butt heads with Cravath, who nonetheless was one of the few people who was able to work with him. In 1898 they became Long Island neighbors and on January 1, 1901, full-fledged partners in Guthrie, Cravath &amp; Henderson. It was here that Cravath put his pioneering notions of law firm management into practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually the Cravath name would become the most recognized one in the world of white shoe Wall Street law firms. In the meantime, two other high-powered corporate lawyers stood atop their profession as builders of the new industrialized society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Send Your Man to My Man"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As J. P. Morgan prepared to meet with President Theodore Roosevelt on the morning of February 22, 1902, Frank Stetson had every reason to be proud of the legal work he had performed for Morgan over the past year. In early 1901 he had helped Morgan create United States Steel, the first billion-dollar corporation in world history. Later that year Stetson represented Morgan in forming the second-biggest company on the globe: the Northern Securities Company, a combination of major railroads. Both deals had helped cement Morgan's status as one of the most powerful and richest men in America, and Stetson's as its highest-paid lawyer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But by the time Morgan arrived for his White House appointment on this particular Saturday morning, he was boiling over with anger. He was there to discuss a new antitrust lawsuit that Roosevelt's attorney general, Philander K. Knox, had just filed to stop the giant Northern Securities merger. Three days earlier, over dinner at his large brownstone on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, the sixty-four-year-old Morgan had professed shock to his gues...</p></p><h2>American Scriptures: An Anthology of Sacred Writings (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>A groundbreaking collection of sacred Christian writings of American origin from Mormons, Shakers, Christian Scientists, and others. </b> <br><br> "Scripture" is any work in which the authors, translators, editors, or discoverers all claim to have received wisdom from a source outside themselves, be it revelation, enlightened philosophy, or ancient archive.

A groundbreaking radical leftist author and thinker, she has contributed to numerous publications, including <i>Rolling Stone</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, and the <i>Nation</i>, and was the founder of the Cultural Reporting and Criticism program at New York University. Her work is published in three other books of essays: <i>Out of the Vinyl Deeps, No More Nice Girls, </i>and<i> Don&#x2019;t Think, Smile!</i></p>This anthology collects the book reviews, feminist political essays and fiction that Willis, formerly a Village Voice columnist and now a New York University associate professor of journalism, published during the Reagan-Bush years. The book opens with several works from the early '80s that tediously address psychosexual issues within the feminist movement. Beyond these exercises in anti-misogynist rhetoric, however, lie many outstanding works. In "Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism," Willis chronicles the internal struggles, strategies and consequent splintering of the women's movement, while in "Escape From New York" she writes nostalgically of her fellow aging radicals and their compromises. In more recent pieces Willis eloquently argues her pro-choice position on abortion and offers a balanced perspective on the racial division within the women's movement. Essays on the issues of parental responsibility in an age of reproductive choice and on the war on drugs demonstrate her ability to communicate strong, rational arguments for emotionally charged liberal philosophies. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>City of Windows: A Novel (Lucas Page, 1)</h2><p><p><b>"<i>City of Windows</i> is moving, breathtaking&#x2015;a great entertainment." &#x2015;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> </b><br><b></b><br><b>&#x201c;A tough, wise, knowing narrative voice, a great plot, a great setting, and even better characters &#x2015; I loved this.&#x201d; &#x2015;Lee Child, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</b></p><p><i>In the tradition of Jeffery Deaver&#x2019;s Lincoln Rhyme and David Baldacci&#x2019;s Amos Decker, Robert Pobi's </i>City of Windows<i> introduces Lucas Page, a brilliant, reluctant investigator, matching wits with a skilled, invisible killer</i><br><i></i><br>During the worst blizzard in memory, an FBI agent in a moving SUV in New York City is killed by a nearly impossible sniper shot.

Kieran and Timberlake argue that the time has come to re-evaluate and update the basic design and construction methods that have constrained the building industry throughout its history. They skillfully demonstrate that contemporary architectural construction is a linear process, in both design and construction, where segregation of intelligence and information is the norm. They convince the reader to look at the automobile, shipbuilding, and aerospace industries to learn how to incorporate collective intelligence and nonhierarchical production structures. Those industries have proven to be progressively economic, efficient, and they yield a higher quality product while the production of buildings stagnates in the methods and practices of the nineteenth century. The transfer they envision is the complete integration of design with the craft of assembly supported by the materials scientist, the product engineer, and the process engineer, all using the tools of present information science as the central enabler.<p></p>The new architecture will not be about style, but rather about substance -- about the very methods and processes that underlie making.</p><p>In 1984 <b>Stephen Kieran, FAIA, FAAR,</b> and <b>James Timberlake, FAIA, FAAR</b> founded the firm KieranTimberlake Associates LLP, located in Philadelphia. KieranTimberlake Associates LLP has been awarded 40 design awards during the past 20 years, including two Gold Medals and two Distinguished Building Awards from the American Institute of Architects. <p></p> Stephen Kieran received his Bachelor's degree from Yale University, magna cum laude, and his Master of Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania. <p></p> James Timberlake received his Bachelor's degree from the University of Detroit, with honors, and his Master of Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania, with honors. <p></p> Stephen Kieran and James Timberlake were recipients of the Rome Prize (in 1981 and 1983 respectively) from the American Academy in Rome, and have served as Eero Saarinen Distinguished Professor of Design at Yale University. They were awarded the inaugural 2001 Benjamin Latrobe Fellowship for architectural design research by the AIA College of Fellows. They are also the Max Fisher Chair recipients at the University of Michigan for Spring 2004. They currently serve as Adjunct Professors at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design where they lead a graduate research studio that explores the emerging interface between architecture as high art and the integration of developing technologies in materials science and product engineering. <p></p> They lecture internationally about the processes and methods that underlie transfer technologies and what has been their involvement in this new architecture.

The principal text included is &#39;The Relevance of the Beautiful&#39;, Gadamer&#39;s most sustained treatment of philosophical aesthetics. The eleven other essays focus particularly on the challenge issued by modern painting and literature to our customary ideas of art, and in turn revitalize our understanding of it. Gadamer demonstrates the continuing importance of such concepts as imitation, truth, symbol, and play for our appreciation of contemporary art, and thereby establishes its continuity with the Western tradition. The essays here are not technical and are readily accessible to the beginning student and the general reader. The collection as a whole serves to illustrate the practice of hermeneutics and to introduce Gadamer&#39;s thought. Robert Bernasconi provides an introduction clarifying the central aims of the essays and their relations to Gadamer&#39;s major work, Truth and Method, and to the philosophy of art since Kant. A bibliography of Gadamer&#39;s writings available in English is also included.</p><p>Presents for the first time in English the most important of Gadamer&#39;s extensive writings on art and literature.The essays here are not technical and are readily accessible to the beginning student and the general reader.

This has made <em>Plant Physiology</em> the most authoritative, comprehensive, and widely used upper-division plant biology textbook. In the Sixth Edition, the Growth and Development section (Unit III) has been reorganized and expanded to present the complete life cycle of seed plants from germination to senescence. In recognition of this enhancement, the text has been renamed <em>Plant Physiology and Development</em>. As before, Unit III begins with updated chapters on Cell Walls and Signals and Signal Transduction. The latter chapter has been expanded to include a discussion of major signaling molecules, such as calcium ions and plant hormones. A new, unified chapter entitled Signals from Sunlight has replaced the two Fifth-Edition chapters on Phytochrome and Blue Light Responses. This chapter includes phytochrome, as well as the blue and UV light receptors and their signaling pathways, including phototropins, cryptochromes, and UVR8. The subsequent chapters in Unit III are devoted to describing the stages of development from embryogenesis to senescence and the many physiological and environmental factors that regulate them. The result provides students with an improved understanding of the integration of hormones and other signaling agents in developmental regulation.<br></p><p><br>Lincoln Taiz, Professor Emeritus, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA<br><br>Eduardo Zeiger, Professor Emeritus, University of California, Los Angeles, USA<br><br><strong>Ian M.

In <em>The Lights that Failed: European International History 1919-1933</em>, part of the Oxford History of Modern Europe series, Steiner challenges the common assumption that the Treaty of Versailles led to the opening of a second European war. In a radically original way, this book characterizes the 1920s not as a frustrated prelude to a second global conflict but as a fascinating decade in its own right, when politicians and diplomats strove to re-assemble a viable European order. Steiner examines the efforts that failed but also those which gave hope for future promise, many of which are usually underestimated, if not ignored. She shows that an equilibrium was achieved, attained between a partial American withdrawal from Europe and the self-imposed constraints which the Soviet system imposed on exporting revolution. The stabilization painfully achieved in Europe reached it fragile limits after 1925, even prior to the financial crises that engulfed the continent. The hinge years between the great crash of 1929 and Hitler's achievement of power in 1933 devastatingly altered the balance between nationalism and internationalism. This wide-ranging study helps us grasp the decisive stages in this process. <br><br>In a second volume, The Triumph of the Night , Steiner will examine the immediate lead up to the Second World War and its early years.<br></p><p><br><strong>Zara Steiner</strong> is Emeritus Fellow, New Hall, University of Cambridge.<br><br>"Zara Steiner's work has ensured that we will have to treat that neglected decade [the 1920s] with proper respect.

For there is simply nothing to compare with it in terms of erudition or exposition. Above all Zara Steiner ensures that we read history forward not backward."--<em>The</em> <em>Independent</em><p></p><br>"Majestic and authoritative volume...<em>The Lights that Failed</em> skillfully and judiciously deploys the fruits of extensive reading and long reflection....Embedded in its comprehensive survey of the main protagonists and themes is a radical and fascinating argument."--Mark Mazower, <em>BBC</em><p></p><br>"A dazzling account....This combination of human drama and a broad international perspective, shifting between western, eastern and Atlantic viewpoints, is a governing strength of the narrative, at once providing fascinating detail, balance, and vivid variety of pace and content. Steiner's long, wise view of international relations during the last epoch when western Europe confidently believed itself the centre of the world is compelling reading for anyone concerned with the continent's past--or future."--<em>FT Magazine</em><p></p><br>"Impressive"--David Stevenson, <em>LRB</em><p></p><br>"Zara Steiner has produced a splendid volume, chock full of detail and with many thought-provoking insights.

In order to understand the current nature of citizen engagement, it is critical to separate political from civic engagement. Using the results from an original set of surveys and the authors' own primary research, they conclude that while older citizens participate by voting, young people engage by volunteering and being active in their communities.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Cliff Zukin</strong> is Professor of Political Science and Public Policy at Rutgers University.

The core principles and case studies reflect a deep understanding of the adult survivor&#x2019;s experience as well as the importance of therapist self-awareness and self-reflection. This book's exploration of the therapeutic process is a valuable counterbalance (and complement) to manualized approaches to complex trauma therapy."--Julian D. Ford, PhD, ABPP, Department of Psychiatry, University of Connecticut Health Center<br><br> "The authors have written a tightly reasoned and empathic book on the psychodynamic treatment of complex trauma. It is especially focused on the therapeutic relationship, the clinician's and client&#x2019;s internal experience, the role of dissociative 'parts,' and mind&#x2013;body theories. Although this book diverges to some extent from my own perspective, it offers a balancing force in the face of more manualized, shorter-term models. I salute it for its intelligence and clinical wisdom, and recommend it as a thought-provoking and valuable addition to our current approaches."--John Briere, PhD, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Southern California<br><br> "This book offers a very fine overview of the process of individual therapy with survivors of trauma--although, truth be told, many of its insights apply to therapy with virtually all clients. It will be especially useful for early-career therapists who may not yet fully realize the complexity and importance of their relationship with the client. A major strength of this book is its ongoing exploration of the impact of various aspects of trauma (such as dysregulation) on the therapist and the therapist's responses."--Pamela C.

The "treason of the intellectuals" is a phrase that evokes much but is inherently ambiguous. The book bearing this title is well known but little understood. This edition is introduced by Roger Kimball.</p> <p>From the time of the pre-Socratics, intellectuals were a breed apart. They were non-materialistic knowledge-seekers who believed in a universal humanism and represented a cornerstone of civilized society. According to Benda, this all began to change in the early twentieth century. In Europe in the 1920s, intellectuals began abandoning their attachment to traditional philosophical and scholarly ideals, and instead glorified particularisms and moral relativism.</p> <p>The "treason" of which Benda writes is the betrayal by the intellectuals of their unique vocation. He criticizes European intellectuals for allowing political commitment to insinuate itself into their understanding of the intellectual vocation, ushering the world into "the age of the intellectual organization of political hatreds." From the savage flowering of ethnic and religious hatreds in the Middle East and throughout Europe today to the mendacious demand for political correctness and multiculturalism on college campuses everywhere in the West, the treason of the intellectuals continues to play out its unedifying drama.</p></p><p><p>Julien Benda (1867-1956) was a novelist and critic.

How did information come to be so integral to what we can do? How did we become people who effortlessly present our lives in social media profiles and who are meticulously recorded in state surveillance dossiers and online marketing databases? What is the story behind data coming to matter so much to who we are?<br> In <i>How We Became Our Data,</i> Colin Koopman excavates early moments of our rapidly accelerating data-tracking technologies and their consequences for how we think of and express our selfhood today. Koopman explores the emergence of mass-scale record keeping systems like birth certificates and social security numbers, as well as new data techniques for categorizing personality traits, measuring intelligence, and even racializing subjects. This all culminates in what Koopman calls the &#x201c;informational person&#x201d; and the &#x201c;informational power&#x201d; we are now subject to. The recent explosion of digital technologies that are turning us into a series of algorithmic data points is shown to have a deeper and more turbulent past than we commonly think. Blending philosophy, history, political theory, and media theory in conversation with thinkers like Michel Foucault, J�rgen Habermas, and Friedrich Kittler, Koopman presents an illuminating perspective on how we have come to think of our personhood&#x2014;and how we can resist its erosion.</p></p><p><b>Colin Koopman</b> is associate professor of philosophy and director of the New Media &amp; Culture Program at the University of Oregon.&nbsp;"Koopman examines data collection, as well as the human adoption of such data to represent individual identity, in order to make such practices visible before data becomes our second nature. . . .&nbsp;Koopman&#x2019;s analysis reaches a crescendo when the story turns to personal data&#x2019;s implications. He invites us to think about the thousands of boxes we&#x2019;ve ticked over our lifetimes, beside which are written the conventional words of racial taxonomy. The data collected from these boxes is used to build correlations, supporting all manner of political and economic programs." (<i>Public Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>How We Became Our Data</i> is a landmark contribution to contemporary philosophy of subjectivities and a must-read for anyone interested in the digital age.

Stephen Hawking raised profound issues concerning the loss of information in black hole evaporation and the consistency of quantum mechanics in a world with gravity. For two decades these questions puzzled theoretical physicists and eventually led to a revolution in the way we think about space, time, matter and information. This revolution has culminated in a remarkable principle called &#34;The Holographic Principle&#34;, which is now a major focus of attention in gravitational research, quantum field theory and elementary particle physics.

During these years, stories of Barbary captivity forced the U.S. government to pay humiliating tributes to African rulers, stimulated the drive to create the U.S. Navy, and brought on America's first post-revolutionary war. These tales also were used both to justify and to vilify slavery.<br> <br> The accounts collected here range from the 1798 tale of John Foss, who was ransomed by Thomas Jefferson's administration for tribute totaling a sixth of the annual federal budget, to the story of Ion Perdicaris, whose (probably staged) abduction in Tangier in 1904 prompted Theodore Roosevelt to send warships to Morocco and inspired the 1975 film <i>The Wind and the Lion.</i> Also included is the unusual story of Robert Adams, a light-skinned African American who was abducted by Arabs and used by them to hunt negro slaves; captured by black villagers who presumed he was white; then was sold back to a group of Arabs, from whom he was ransomed by a British diplomat.<br> <br> Long out of print and never before anthologized, these fascinating tales open an entirely new chapter of early American literary history, and shed new light on the more familiar genres of Indian captivity narrative and American slave narrative.<br> <br> "Baepler has done American literary and cultural historians a service by collecting these long-out-of-print Barbary captivity narratives . . . . Baepler's excellent introduction and full bibliography of primary and secondary sources greatly enhance our knowledge of this fascinating genre."&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i></p></p><p>It has been said that the Indian captivity narrative, in which kidnapped or captured colonials reported the hardships of imprisonment at the hands of native people, is the first truly American literary genre. In <i>White Slaves, African Masters</i>, historian Paul Baepler shows that this genre had a precursor in the so-called Barbary captivity narrative, in which some unlucky European (or, later, American) describes life as a slave of the Algerian and Moroccan pashas, rulers of the Barbary Coast. Such narratives form part of Cervantes's <i>Don Quixote</i> and Defoe's <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>; they also make up a large canon of literary, historical, and autobiographical works that are scarcely known today, even among historians. Yet in their time, these writings were widely circulated. Cotton Mather, the famed New England cleric, used several of them to denounce the Muslims of North Africa, proclaiming from the pulpit that being their prisoner was "the most horrible captivity in the world," and Benjamin Franklin drew on Barbary captivity narratives to decry the slave trade of the Southern United States.<p> In this one-of-a-kind anthology, Baepler gathers several noteworthy examples from American sources, beginning with Cotton Mather's sermons, continuing through post-Revolutionary War writings, such as Jonathan Cowdery's "American Captives in Tripoli" (whose daring rescue by U.S. marines provided us with the phrase "the shores of Tripoli"), and ending with a bogus narrative by one Eliza Bradley, whose 1820 memoir went into 13 U.S. editions. The narratives, Baepler reminds us, point to the long pattern of mutual misunderstanding that has prevailed between the United States and the Muslim world. Read as history and literature, these narratives also help illuminate a dark corner of the past. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Baepler (Univ. of Minnesota) has done American literary and cultural historians a service by collecting these long-out-of-print Barbary captivity narratives. These accounts of persons captured by Morocco and the Barbary regencies of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli inform study of the more familiar American slave and Indian captivity narratives. The nine pieces included here (mostly excerpts) span two centuries, from Cotton Mather's "The Glory of Goodness" to Ion Perdicaris's "In Raissuli's Hands," which led to Teddy Roosevelt's launching of warships to Morocco. Most of the works, though, are from 1790 to 1820, when the genre was enormously popular, probably because of the nation's increasing interest in the question of slavery. Baepler's excellent introduction and full bibliography of primary and secondary sources greatly enhance our knowledge of this fascinating genre.

The sparkling redesigned city fostered a culture of energetic crowd-pleasing and multi-sensory amusements that would apprehend and represent real life as spectacle.<br><br>Vanessa R. Schwartz examines the explosive popularity of such phenomena as the boulevards, the mass press, public displays of corpses at the morgue, wax museums, panoramas, and early film. Drawing on a wide range of written and visual materials, including private and business archives, and working at the intersections of art history, literature, and cinema studies, Schwartz argues that "spectacular realities" are part of the foundation of modern mass society. She refutes the notion that modern life produced an unending parade of distractions leading to alienation, and instead suggests that crowds gathered not as dislocated spectators but as members of a new kind of crowd, one united in pleasure rather than protest.</p><p>"An exciting, innovative, and significant work.

They could hardly have been more wrong. The past century has seen the rise of quantum mechanics, relativity, cosmology, particle physics, and solid-state physics, among other fields. These subjects have fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and matter. They have also transformed daily life, inspiring a technological revolution that has included the development of radio, television, lasers, nuclear power, and computers. In <i>Quantum Generations</i>, Helge Kragh, one of the world's leading historians of physics, presents a sweeping account of these extraordinary achievements of the past one hundred years.</p><br><p> The first comprehensive one-volume history of twentieth-century physics, the book takes us from the discovery of X rays in the mid-1890s to superstring theory in the 1990s. Unlike most previous histories of physics, written either from a scientific perspective or from a social and institutional perspective, <i>Quantum Generations</i> combines both approaches. Kragh writes about pure science with the expertise of a trained physicist, while keeping the content accessible to nonspecialists and paying careful attention to practical uses of science, ranging from compact disks to bombs. As a historian, Kragh skillfully outlines the social and economic contexts that have shaped the field in the twentieth century. He writes, for example, about the impact of the two world wars, the fate of physics under Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin, the role of military research, the emerging leadership of the United States, and the backlash against science that began in the 1960s. He also shows how the revolutionary discoveries of scientists ranging from Einstein, Planck, and Bohr to Stephen Hawking have been built on the great traditions of earlier centuries.</p><br><p> Combining a mastery of detail with a sure sense of the broad contours of historical change, Kragh has written a fitting tribute to the scientists who have played such a decisive role in the making of the modern world.</p></p><p>We've seen our most fundamental beliefs about the nature of the universe change so many times over the past century that it's almost old hat. Danish science historian Helge Kragh looks at these revolutions and their effects in <i>Quantum Generations: A History of Physics in the Twentieth Century</i>. This well-told series of interlocking stories skillfully blends hard science with biography; Kragh intends to reach a broad audience and succeeds in maintaining interest on all levels. Starting in the 10 years before 1900, he shows us that the state of physics was not as moribund as textbooks would have us believe--in fact, much of the groundwork for the revelations of relativity and quantum mechanics was laid then. Moving along through the highlights of the past hundred years, we read of Heisenberg, Lorentz, Feynman, and many more scientists building on their predecessors' work.<p> Only the most pathologically math-phobic need fear this book; Kragh has done nonphysicists a favor by restricting his scientific discussions to terms understandable by most well-informed readers. Though he does neglect certain important fields (e.g., optics and materials science), the cohesion and relative brevity resulting from this decision make for a better book. Whether you have an abiding interest in the roots of modern physics or want to learn more about recent developments in unification theories, you'll find <i>Quantum Generations</i> a pleasant yet challenging review. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><p>"Helge Kragh's book is a magnificent achievement. It is a rich, erudite history of physics from the end of the nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth that is also informative and insightful about social, cultural, political, and institutional contexts. Kragh has included developments at the physics-applied physics-technology interface and has thus given an unusually comprehensive and balanced account of twentieth-century physics. What is equally impressive is that the book is readily accessible to the general reader and will also be valued by scientists and historians."<b>--S.S. Schweber, author of <i>QED and the Men Who Made It: Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga</i></b></p><p>"This book will come to be seen as an indispensable reference for those who seek a full understanding of its topic--which, of course, is one of the most important topics in modern history."<b>--Spencer R. Weart, American Institute of Physics</b></p><p>"Kragh has succeeded in presenting an engaging and comprehensive history of the development of physics in this century, one that will be accessible to a wide audience. This book will surely become a standard reference for students of twentieth-century science."<b>--Ronald Anderson, Boston College</b></p></p><h2>Instructional Design, Third Edition</h2><p><b>Basic principles and practical strategies to promote learning in any setting!</b> <p>From K-12 to corporate training settings&#x2013;&#x2013;the Third Edition of Patricia Smith and Tillman Ragan&#x2019;s thorough, research-based text equips you with the solid foundation you need to design instruction and environments that really facilitate learning.</p> <p>Now updated to reflect the latest thinking in the field, this new edition offers not only extensive procedural assistance but also emphasizes the basic principles upon which most of the models and procedures in the instructional design field are built.

The book will delight the general reader who knows little about Nietzsche's ideas. The specialist will learn where Young stands in relation to the voluminous scholarship on Nietzsche." <br><b>- Christopher Cumo, Independent Scholar, Canadian Journal of History</b><br></p><p>In this beautifully written account, Julian Young provides the most comprehensive biography available today of the life and philosophy of the nineteenth-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Young deals with the many puzzles created by the conjunction of Nietzsche&#39;s personal history and his work: Why the son of a Lutheran pastor developed into the self-styled &#34;Antichrist&#34;; why this archetypical Prussian came to loath Bismarck&#39;s Prussia; and why this enemy of feminism preferred the company of feminist women. Setting Nietzsche&#39;s thought in the context of his times - the rise of Prussian militarism, anti-Semitism, Darwinian science, the &#34;Youth&#34; and emancipationist movements, as well as the &#34;death of God&#34; - Young emphasizes the decisive influence of Plato and of Richard Wagner on Nietzsche&#39;s attempted reform of Western culture.

These "nones" now outnumber even the largest Protestant denominations in America. They are not to be confused with secularists, however, for many of them identify themselves as "spiritual but not religious" (SBNR). The response to this dramatic change in American religion has been amazingly mixed. While social scientists have been busy counting and categorizing them, the public has swung between derision and adulation. Some complain "nones" are simply shallow dilettantes, narcissistically concerned with their own inner world. Others hail them as spiritual giants, and ground-breaking pioneers. Rarely, however, have these "nones" been asked to explain their own views, beliefs, and experiences. In <em>Belief without Borders</em>, theologian and one-time SBNR Linda Mercadante finally gives these individuals a chance to speak for themselves.<br><br>This volume is the result of extensive observation and nearly 100 in-depth interviews with SBNRs across the United States. Mercadante presents SBNRs' stories, shows how they analyze their spiritual journeys, and explains why they reject the claims of organized religion. Surprisingly, however, Mercadante finds these SBNRs within as well as outside the church. She reveals the unexpected, emerging latent theology within this group, including the interviewees' creative concepts of divine transcendence, life after death, human nature, and community. The conclusions she draws are startling: despite the fact that SBNRs routinely discount the creeds and doctrines of organized religion, many have devised a structured set of beliefs, often purposefully in opposition to doctrines associated with Christianity.<br><br><em>Belief without Borders</em> is a captivating exploration of a growing belief system certain to transform the spiritual character of America.<br></p><p><br><strong>Linda Mercadante</strong> is the B.

It is full of voices-Mercadante lets her interviewees speak for themselves, in their own terms-and is held together by her own voice, which is clear, concrete, and candid. And respectful: she takes her conversation partners seriously enough to challenge them. "--<em>Nova Religio</em><p></p><br>"For those who think that being 'spiritual but not religious' is intellectually vague, it is time to think again. In <em>Belief without Borders</em>, Linda Mercadante explores the beliefs of the religiously unaffiliated regarding God, sin, community, the afterlife, and ethics and finds people living 'between' the worlds of secularism and traditional faith. By taking the new spiritual impulse seriously as theology, she affirms the power of spiritual experience as a force remaking the patterns of contemporary faith." --Diana Butler Bass, author of <em>Christianity After Religion: The End of Church</em> <em>and the Birth of a New Spiritual Awakening</em><p></p><br>"In the tradition of Robert Bellah's <em>Habits of the Heart</em>, Mercadante here offers us a brilliant narrative introduction to the theology and belief systems of the 'Spiritual but not Religious' among us. Highly accessible and rife with insightful commentary, <em>Belief without Borders</em> is far and away the richest study I have seen to date of the SBNR and is destined to become a classic in the field." --Phyllis Tickle, author of <em>The Great Emergence: How Christianity Is Changing and Why</em><p></p><br>"<em>Belief without Borders</em> breaks new ground by describing the growing 'spiritual but not religious' population in the United States. Drawing on in-depth interviews, Mercadante finds that the 'spiritual but not religious' are critical of both organized religion and the secular world. The book offers an analysis of the role of belief in contemporary America. It is a welcome and much needed contribution." --John C.

This book reveals how a self-styled parametric and post-critical architecture serves mechanisms of control and compliance while promoting itself, at the same time, as progressive. Spencer's incisive analysis of the architecture and writings of figures such as Zaha Hadid, Patrik Schumacher, Rem Koolhaas, Greg Lynn and Alejandro Zaera-Polo shows them to be in thrall to the same notions of liberty as are propounded in neoliberal thought. <br>Analysing architectural projects in the fields of education, consumption and labour, <i>The Architecture of Neoliberalism</i> examines the part played by contemporary architecture in refashioning human subjects into the compliant figures - student-entrepreneurs, citizen-consumers and team-workers - requisite to the universal implementation of a form of existence devoted to market imperatives.</p></p><p>Provocative and rigorously-argued, this is an uncompromising critique of contemporary global architecture and its relationship to neoliberalism, theory and the exercise of power.Douglas Spencer teaches and writes on critical theories of architecture, landscape and urbanism.

But the question of how we understand the British Empire--its origins, nature, purpose, and effect on the world it ruled--is far from settled. In this incisive work, David Cannadine looks at the British Empire from a new perspective--through the eyes of those who created and ruled it--and offers fresh insight into the driving forces behind the Empire. Arguing against the views of Edward Said and others, Cannadine suggests that the British were motivated not only by race, but also by class. The British wanted to domesticate the exotic world of their colonies and to reorder the societies they ruled according to an idealized image of their own class hierarchies.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Cannadine</strong> is Professor of History and Director of the Institute of Historical Research at London University.

Trevelyan: A Life in History</em>.<br><br>"A lively account....As entertaining in its anecdotes as it is thought-provoking."--<em>Boston Globe</em><p></p><br>"Cannadine is excellent on the uses of pageantry and on the kitschy extremes it had reached by the nineteen-twenties."--<em>New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"A thoughtful and spirited book....In the privacy of their small worlds, away from the postmodernists and the radical historians writing 'peripheral' history, there can be heard fond retrospects of the empire and its pageantry by ordinary, unfashionable men and women. Were these people to tell us what they recall of the empire's doings, I suspect that they would echo some of the truths of Cannadine's subtle and learned retrieval of that imperial history."--Fouad Ajami, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"A study of British imperial attitudes that is light in size and tone but filled with weighty significance. In less than 200 pages of text, he has reopened the debate on the British Empire and has brought fresh insight into the ways that nations project their power around the globe."--<em>The</em> <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em><p></p><br>"This is a lovely book, full of insights and unfamiliar perspectives. Were the rulers of Victoria's Empire more snobbish or more racist? They hardly knew the difference, for the common people of their own nation were very little less mysterious or threatening to them than the dark sullen masses of India or Africa. At least this much can be said, though, and David Cannadine says it: The snobbery diluted and tempered the racism."--John Derbyshire, <em>National Review</em><p></p><br>"Cannadine writes with insight, felicity and wit."--<em>The Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"<em>Ornamentalism is well written and closely argued."--Southern Humanities Review<p></p></em><br>"Offers a fresh perspective on the British Empire and its creators."--<em>Chicago Tribune</em><p></p><br>"Like everything that Cannadine writes...<em>Ornamentalism</em> is vigorous, stimulating, and bursting with ideas....It should be read by anyone who is interested in politics and society in the British Empire."--Philip Ziegler, <em>The Spectator</em><p></p><br>"A fresh perspective on British history, in which Cannadine argues against racial interpretations of colonialism and maintains that the British Empire was sustained by a universal respect for social class....A controversial work that is sure to spark debate and painstaking and temperate argument, written with a good command of the facts and a remarkable sense of proportion."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"Cannadine is excellent on the uses of pageantry and on the kitschy extremes it had reached by the nineteen-twenties."--<em>New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"A lively account...The basic, and quite intriguing, argument is that the British designed their empire not on the basis of racial subjugation, but of class privilege--the same hierarchy of class privilege that guided and ruled British society itself...<em>Ornamentalism</em> is as entertaining in its anecdotes as it is thought- provoking."--<em>Boston Globe</em><p></p><br>"David Cannadine's <em>Ornamentalism</em> is so stimulating and original that it will now and forever after be read hand in hand with Edward Said's <em>Orientalism</em>. Cannadine's vision is quite different. He brilliantly recovers the world-view and social presuppositions of those who dominated and ruled the Empire, and thus restores the Empire to British social history. No other work succeeds as well in putting the history of Britain back into the history of the empire, and the history of the empire back into the history of Britain."--Wm. Roger Louis, Editor-in-Chief, <em>The Oxford History of the British</em> <em>Empire</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Readings in Classical Rhetoric</h2><p>Rhetoric -- the theory of oral discourse -- affected and indeed pervaded all aspects of classical thought. Bearing the stamp of its impact were the Homeric hymns, the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey,</i> Aeschylus' <i>Eumenides,</i> the great dramatic tragedies, the elegiac and lyric poetry, and the literature of the Romans, often formed in the Greek image. The rhetorical notion of probability had direct implications for the classical philosopher and mathematician as it does today. <br> <br> Departments of speech, English, philosophy and classics provide the key centers of interest in the new and the classical rhetorics. Despite the considerable enthusiasm for the study of rhetoric, no single work provides large selections of primary materials written by the classical rhetoricians themselves. Until now, only secondary sources containing tiny excerpts, or entire and expensive translations of the ancient rhetorical writings were available. This large anthology of primary readings of the classical rhetoricians in translation fills this large gap. <br> <br> The continuity and coherence of ancient rhetorical traditions is emphasized by organizing large excerpts into the topical divisions that later classical writers agreed upon. The first unit of this anthology sets forth major issues in the definition and scope of rhetoric, and its appropriate place among other modes of thought and discourse. Parts 2 through 5 are organized according to the traditional canons of oratory -- invention, disposition, style, memory, and delivery. In organizing the readings this way, the editors represent both the philosophical and theoretical issues in rhetoric and its pragmatic functions as a craft for making effective discourse. <br> <br> Selecting excerpts that illustrate the major conflicts within the unfolding tradition enables a sampling of not only the major points of view, but also the arguments supporting them. This volume includes selections not only from writings of the standard classical rhetoricians but also from less typical works which have special value. The editors have utilized the best accessible translations while remaining absolutely faithful to their texts.<br></p><p>Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Neuroscience and Social Work Practice: The Missing Link</h2><p>Over the past 30 years, findings in the neurosciences have grown exponentially and have provided a profound understanding of the link between behavior and biology.

User-friendly features include case examples, advice on writing reports and giving feedback to clients, and a detailed sample report.</p><p>Julie A. Suhr, PhD, is Professor of Psychology at Ohio University. Her current research interests include the effects of psychological (non-neurological) variables on neuropsychological performance and aspects of executive functioning in individuals with various neurological conditions. Dr. Suhr has taught graduate courses in personality assessment, intellectual assessment, and clinical neuropsychology, and supervises clinical assessments in the training clinic as part of the doctoral training program in clinical psychology."Unlike most assessment texts, this book focuses on the entire assessment process rather than just providing information about various psychological tests. This is a welcome change that will be particularly useful to students and professionals who want to think more broadly about assessment. Suhr approaches assessment like a detective. Her book provides countless insights into everything from formulating initial impressions and incorporating psychological test data to writing reports and providing feedback."--Dustin B. Wygant, PhD, Department of Psychology, Eastern Kentucky University<br><br> "By providing a model of psychological assessment that bridges research, clinical skill, and careful reasoning, this book moves assessment training forward. The mental health care system will increasingly focus on outcomes, specialization, and integration. Suhr places efficient, focused assessment practice in the context of a deep clinical sensibility to help students apply psychological science to clinical care in a manner that transcends questionable diagnostic categories or narrow theoretical orientations."--Christopher J. Hopwood, PhD, Department of Psychology, Michigan State University<br><br> &#x201c;As a trainer of school psychologists for 25 years, I teach evidence-based assessment by emphasizing the practitioner's role as a 'cognitive detective' who tries to figure out the unique cognitive strengths and weaknesses of each examinee. Suhr has expanded the notion of a 'cognitive detective' into a useful desk reference for practitioners and a wonderful text for graduate students new to assessment. I am particularly fond of the biopsychosocial focus, which is very pertinent to our field today."--Daniel C.

It begins in A.D. 285, when the emperor Diocletian separated what became Byzantium from the western Roman Empire, and ends in 1461, when the last Byzantine outposts fell to the Ottoman Turks.</p> <p>Spanning twelve centuries and three continents, the Byzantine Empire linked the ancient and modern worlds, shaping and transmitting Greek, Roman, and Christian traditions&#x2015;including the Greek classics, Roman law, and Christian theology&#x2015;that remain vigorous today, not only in Eastern Europe and the Middle East but throughout Western civilization. Though in its politics Byzantium often resembled a third-world dictatorship, it has never yet been matched in maintaining a single state for so long, over a wide area inhabited by heterogeneous peoples.</p> <p>Drawing on a wealth of original sources and modern works, the author treats political and social developments as a single vivid story, told partly in detailed narrative and partly in essays that clarify long-term changes. He avoids stereotypes and rejects such old and new historical orthodoxies as the persistent weakness of the Byzantine economy and the pervasive importance of holy men in Late Antiquity.</p> <p>Without neglecting underlying social, cultural, and economic trends, the author shows the often crucial impact of nearly a hundred Byzantine emperors and empresses. What the emperor or empress did, or did not do, could rapidly confront ordinary Byzantines with economic ruin, new religious doctrines, or conquest by a foreign power. Much attention is paid to the complex life of the court and bureaucracy that has given us the adjective "byzantine." The major personalities include such famous names as Constantine, Justinian, Theodora, and Heraclius, along with lesser-known figures like Constans II, Irene, Basil II the Bulgar-Slayer, and Michael VIII Palaeologus.</p> <p>Byzantine civilization emerges as durable, creative, and realistic, overcoming repeated setbacks to remain prosperous almost to the end. With 221 illustrations and 18 maps that complement the text, <i>A History of the Byzantine State and Society</i> should long remain the standard history of Byzantium not just for students and scholars but for all readers.</p></p><p>&#x201c;A vivid story of Byzantium&#x2019;s existence over the span of 1,100 years. . . .

For that reason, when creating a program, we ensure that the material will be accessible to as many students as possible. As such, we create many ancillary products that fit specific situations and meet a variety of needs. While there are many components to each of our overall educational programs, some of these ancillaries do not meet the needs of homeschoolers, others do not make sense in a homeschool environment and some require an expensive technological infrastructure to deploy. The homeschool product configurations, while selected from a larger program, are complete curriculum bundles designed to engage your children and help them thrive while being mindful of your budget. It is important to note that at times there will be resources mentioned throughout our curriculum material descriptions that are not included in your package. However this will not hinder your child's successful completion of the course. Rather, the exclusion of certain materials will make homeschooling more budget-friendly and will ensure your curriculum meets your individual needs.</p></p><p></p><h2>In God&#39;s Path: The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire (Ancient Warfare and Civilization)</h2><p>In just over a hundred years--from the death of Muhammad in 632 to the beginning of the Abbasid Caliphate in 750--the followers of the Prophet swept across the whole of the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain. Their armies threatened states as far flung as the Franks in Western Europe and the Tang Empire in China. The conquered territory was larger than the Roman Empire at its greatest expansion, and it was claimed for the Arabs in roughly half the time. How this collection of Arabian tribes was able to engulf so many empires, states, and armies in such a short period has perplexed historians for centuries. Most accounts of the Arab invasions have been based almost solely on the early Muslim sources, which were composed centuries later to illustrate the divinely chosen status of the Arabs. <br><br>Robert Hoyland's groundbreaking new history assimilates not only the rich biographical information of the early Muslim sources but also the many non-Arabic sources, contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous with the conquests. <em>In God's Path</em> begins with a broad picture of the Late Antique world prior to the Prophet's arrival, a world dominated by two superpowers: Byzantium and Sasanian Persia. In between these empires, emerged a distinct Arabian identity, which helped forge the inhabitants of western Arabia into a formidable fighting force. The Arabs are the principal actors in this drama yet, as Hoyland shows, the peoples along the edges of Byzantium and Persia--the Khazars, Bulgars, Avars, and Turks--all played critical roles in the remaking of the old world order. The new faith propagated by Muhammad and his successors made it possible for many of the conquered peoples to join the Arabs in creating the first Islamic Empire. Well-paced, comprehensive, and eminently readable,<em> In God's Path </em>presents a sweeping narrative of a transformational period in world history.<br></p><p><br>Professor of Late Antique and Early Islamic Middle Eastern History at New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, <strong>Robert G.

His book will surely serve as the definitive account of the Arab conquests for many years to come." --Tom Holland, <em>Literary Review</em><p></p><br>"<em>In God's Path</em> is a thoughtful and nuanced guide to an age that was far more complex than we might imagine from older accounts." --Philip Jenkins, <em>Books &amp; Culture</em><p></p><br>"An illuminating, richly detailed, highly readable study of one of the crucial periods of history." --<em>First Things</em><p></p><br>"This is perhaps the best introduction to the Arab-Islamic Conquests available. Never before has this story been told on the basis of such a wide range of sources, as Hoyland draws discerningly on the testimony of both contemporary non-Muslims and of the classical Islamic tradition. The author's elegant style, fascinating observations, and sharp analysis bring one of history's great moments to life, for the benefit of students, scholars, and the general public. This book is original, authoritative, and a joy to read--I cannot recommend it highly enough." --Adam Silverstein, author of <em>Islamic History: A Very Short Introduction</em><p></p><br>"With its exceptional clarity, balanced judgment of both Muslim and non-Muslim sources, and a broad perspective that encompasses peripheral peoples, Robert Hoyland's new book provides an account of the rise of Islam that is as definitive as it is accessible." --G.

Also, the impacts of releasing CO2 in particular as a greenhouse gas are persistent; they won't just go away after a few years. <br><br><strong>What is the one thing you wish more people understood about global warming? </strong><br>That there really isn't any doubt that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, that adding CO2 to the atmosphere is already changing Earth's climate, and that there's no real scientific reason to hope that climate impacts in the future won't be severe, and worth avoiding. <br><br><strong>When did you first become interested in the subject matter you teach? </strong><br>I am interested in the cycles and balances of chemicals through the environment, the way that the natural world keeps itself regulated and in balance. I went to oceanography school from my native Indiana without knowing much at all about the science of the oceans. My work in oceanography pertains to the carbon cycle; for example, how the CO2 concentrations of the air and water interact with each other. I started teaching this class to non-science majors, and found that non-scientists can understand the science, down to the fundamentals, if we start from the beginning. <br><br><strong>What would you say to people who don&#x2019;t believe global warming is real and dispute the scientific evidence that backs it up? </strong><br>If there were scientific arguments on both sides, then they should be considered. But most of the arguments disputing a present and future human impact on climate seem to be constructed specifically to fool non-scientists, or to give them an excuse to discount the issue. <br><br><strong>What are the biggest contributors to global warming and is it possible to reverse the process? </strong><br>The biggest contributors to the problem are the people of the United States, who emit more CO2 per capita than just about anyone in the world. If the whole world were to adopt the American lifestyle, the rate of CO2 emission would increase by a factor of about five. We are leading the world to ruin. <br><br><strong>What can we expect in the next 100 years going forward, if global warming continues? </strong><br>I think droughts and storminess would be the most noticeable differences.<p><strong>David Archer</strong> is the author of <em>Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast</em>, published by John Wiley and Sons and a book for popular audiences called <em>The Long Thaw: How Humans are Changing the Next 100,000 years of the Earth's Climate</em>, published by Princeton University Press and winner of the 2009 Walter P. Kistler Award, <em>The Foundation for the Future</em>.<br>Since 1993, Archer has been a professor in the department of Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago and has worked on a wide range of topics pertaining to the global carbon cycle and its relation to the global climate, with a special focus on ocean sedimentary processes such as CaCO3 dissolution and methane hydrate formation and their impact on the evolution of atmospheric CO2.<br>He currently teaches classes on global warming, environmental chemistry and global geochemical cycles.</p></p><h2>Dance Production: Design and Technology</h2><p><p><em>Dance Production: Design and Technology</em> introduces you to the skills you need to plan, design, and execute the technical aspects of a dance production. While it may not seem that staging a dance production is that different from a play or musical, in reality a dance performance offers up unique intricacies and challenges all its own, from scenery that accommodates choreography, to lighting design that sculpts the body, and costumes that complement movement. This unique book approaches the process of staging a dance production from a balanced perspective, making it an essential resource for dancers and designers alike.</p> <p></p> <p>Covering a broad range of topics, author Jeromy Hopgood takes the reader through the process of producing dance from start to finish &#x2013; including pre-production planning (collaboration, production process, personnel, performance spaces), design disciplines (lighting, sound, scenery, costumes, projections), stage management, and more. Bridging the gap between theatrical and dance design, the book includes a quick reference guide for theatrical and dance terminology, useful in giving dancers and designers a common working vocabulary that will ensure productive communication across the different fields.</p></p><p><b> </b> <br>Jeromy Hopgood is an educator, author, and freelance designer whose home base is in Michigan.

Not only does it interpret, with clarity and energy, fundamental Christian beliefs but it also shows how and why these beliefs arose, promoting an understanding of theological reflection that encourages readers to think theologically themselves. <p>From Irenaeus and Aquinas to Girard, from Augustine to Zizioulas and contemporary feminist thought, <i>Divine Teaching</i> explores the ways in which major thinkers in the Christian tradition have shaped theology through the wide variety of their encounters with God. It makes theological study adventurous and interactive, not necessarily requiring a faith commitment from all, but allowing readers a thoughtful involvement in the subject that takes seriously the Christian vision of God as the ultimate teacher of theology.</p> <p><i>Divine Teaching: An Introduction to Christian Theology</i> is an imaginative and lively analysis of the Christian way of thinking, offering vivid and informing insight into the history and practice of Christian theology.</p></p><p><b>Mark A.

The exercises emphasize the principles and methods by which geologists discover the origins and changing nature of our planet. <p>These exercises or "studies" will help students understand how ancient conditions can be read from rocks and fossils, how geologic forces at the surface and within the planet can alter the environment, and how events of the past can be placed within an integrated chronological sequence. The exercises are designed for students who may not intend to specialize in geology. This does not mean, however, that the treatment is superficial, nor that it cannot give adequate preparation for students pursuing an academic major in the earth sciences.</p></p><p></p><h2>Elementary Symbolic Logic</h2><p>This volume offers a serious study of the fundamentals of symbolic logic that will neither frustrate nor bore the reader. The emphasis is on developing the reader&#39;s grasp of standard techniques and concepts rather than on achieving a high degree of sophistication. Coverage embraces all of the standard topics in sentential and quantificational logic, including multiple quantification, relations, and identity. Semantic and deductive topics are carefully distinguished, and appendices include an optional discussion of metatheory for sentential logic and truth trees.</p><p>&#34;This remains a superb basic primer in symbolic logic. Great clarity on basic concepts.&#34; --Gary Jason, California State University, Fullerton</p><h2>Seashore Life of the Northern Pacific Coast: An Illustrated Guide to Northern California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia</h2><p>On the northern Pacific coast, from Monterey Bay to Vancouver Island, zoologist Eugene Kozloff explores the rich variety of seashore life of the northern Pacific coast.

The text, cross-referenced with figures and plates, describes in precise terms the size, color, activities, and peculiarities of the plants and animals most likely to be encountered.<br><br>This book is a greatly expanded version of the author&#x2019;s popular Seashore Life of Puget Sound, the Strait of Georgia, and the San Juan Archipelago, published in 1973. It includes much new material on marine life along the open coast and in coastal bays, and extends the coverage to Oregon and northern California. Years of additional study make this the definitive work on the common seashore life of the northern Pacific coast.<br><br>Kozloff discusses the geology and geography of the area, and gives the reader &#x201c;some instant zoology and botany&#x201d; with which to make the most of seashore exploration. He presents more than 650 species of plants and animals, each in its individual habitat, in chapters dealing with &#x201c;Floating Docks and Pilings,&#x201d; &#x201c;Rocky Shores of the Puget Sound Region,&#x201d; &#x201c;Rocky Shores of the Open Coast,&#x201d; &#x201c;Sandy Beaches,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Quiet Bays and Salt Marshes.&#x201d; He also explains the laws and customs governing the collection of biological material and how animals respond to changes in their environment. Clearly and convincingly, he communicates pleasure in, and respect for, diverse marine habitats.<br><br>This book is not only for the use of professional biologists and students; it will add to the pleasure of all who visit the Pacific seashores, ranging from secluded inlets in the San Juan Islands to the magnificent rocky outer coast and tidal estuary of San Francisco Bay.</p><p>From Monterey Bay to northern British Columbia, zoologist Eugene Kozloff describes the common plants and animals that inhabit rocky shores, sandy beaches, and quiet bays and estuaries.NTRMAR</p><h2>Knock Knock Jokes (Dover Kids Activity Books)</h2><p><p>"Knock, Knock."

Like his legendary <i>Invention of Morel</i>, it is an intoxicating mixture of fantasy, sly humor, and menace. Whether read as a fable of modern politics, a meditation on the elusive parameters of the self, or a most unusual love story, Bioy's book is an almost scarily perfect comic turn, as well as a pure delight.</p></p><p>Adolfo Bioy Casares (1914&#x2013;1999) was born in Buenos Aires, the child of wealthy parents. He began to write in the early Thirties, and his stories appeared in the influential magazine <i>Sur</i>, through which he met his wife, the painter and writer Silvina Ocampo, as well Jorge Luis Borges, who was to become his mentor, friend, and collaborator. In 1940, after writing several novice works, Bioy published the novella <i>The Invention of Morel</i>, the first of his books to satisfy him, and the first in which he hit his characteristic note of uncanny and unexpectedly harrowing humor. Later publications include stories and novels, among them <i>A Plan for Escape</i>, <i>A Dream of Heroes</i>, and <i>Asleep in the Sun</i>. Bioy also collaborated with Borges on an A<i>nthology of Fantastic Literature</i> and a series of satirical sketches written under the pseudonym of H.

That's the question a celebrated coach poses to Katie and Eric Knox after he sees their daughter Devon, a gymnastics prodigy and Olympic hopeful, compete. For the Knoxes there are no limits--until a violent death rocks their close-knit gymnastics community and everything they have worked so hard for is suddenly at risk. <br><br>As rumors swirl among the other parents, Katie tries frantically to hold her family together while also finding herself irresistibly drawn to the crime itself.

At first it seemed as if the ghost was on fire, but that was only a trick of the light. It was already quite dark along the cobblestone walk that crossed beneath the tower, so the light that emanated from the ghost filled the courtyard with an unearthly brilliance.<br><br>Eleven people were passing the tower in the moment that the apparition appeared. Three were professors who had seen many ghosts in Oxford, and so gave it no notice. Two more, also faculty at Magdalen, felt similarly about pirate costumes, and merely sniffed their annoyance as they passed, assuming as they did that it was some sort of student mischief. Four more were actual students, who reacted with surprise, awe, and no small amount of fear, and they scattered into corridors adjacent to the tower.<br><br>The last two people who witnessed the ghost&#x2019;s appearance were Caretakers of the <i>Imaginarium Geographica</i>, and a ghost pirate was at least as interesting as some of the other fantastic things they had seen, so they moved closer to have a better look.<br><br>John had arranged to meet his friend Charles at the base of Magdalen Tower so that they might walk together to their friend Jack&#x2019;s private rooms there at the college, and they met just as the sun was setting. It was in that moment that the apparition had appeared.<br><br>Even if they hadn&#x2019;t been Caretakers, a ghost would have been nothing to cause them alarm&#x2014;Oxford had long had a reputation of being a haven to spectres and spirits of all kinds, and as long as they didn&#x2019;t disrupt the business of the university, no one made a fuss. Even in the midst of the Second World War, it was also good for tourism.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d ever actually see this fellow,&#x201d; John whispered to Charles. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard about the Old Pirate for years but never had the pleasure of seeing him in person, uh, so to speak.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How many other ghosts have you met here?&#x201d; asked Charles.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, none, I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x201d; John admitted, &#x201c;although I haven&#x2019;t exactly sought them out, either.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, why not?&#x201d; Charles retorted as he approached the ghost, hand outstretched. &#x201c;They could prove to be really helpful to my writing, you know. Worth asking, anyroad.&#x201d;<br><br>The ghost simply stood there, hunched over, staring into the darkness as the Caretaker introduced himself. &#x201c;Well met, old fellow. My name is Charles.&#x201d;<br><br>Suddenly the ghost began to move, jerking about awkwardly, as if it were a puppet in a penny nickelodeon. It seemed as if speaking to it had engaged it in some way. Charles dropped his hand. &#x201c;Are you in distress?&#x201d; he asked the ghost. &#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d;<br><br>The ghost stopped, then turned and focused its rheumy eyes on Charles, who took full stock of it for the first time. The spectre had presence and looked as if it stood in bright sunlight&#x2014;but it was transparent, ethereal.<br><br>By appearance, it was certainly a pirate, no doubt, but an ancient one, many, many years old. His hair was long and straggly, and the clothes he wore, once fine, were tattered with age. His hands were shaking, and his head twitched nervously. But his eyes were piercing, intense&#x2014;and, Charles thought with surprise, oddly familiar.<br><br>&#x201c;Caretakers?&#x201d; the ghost said with a trembling voice. &#x201c;Be ye Caretakers, here, at Oxford?&#x201d;<br><br>Charles and John exchanged surprised looks. This was no run-of-the-mill ghost. Not if he knew who they were. Then again, there had been stories of the Pirate Ghost appearing in this spot for two centuries, and no one had ever reported that he spoke at all, much less that he had mentioned anything about Caretakers.<br><br>&#x201c;Who is asking?&#x201d; said John, stepping forward. &#x201c;Who are you looking for?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jamie?&#x201d; the ghost answered. &#x201c;Jamie, is that you?&#x201d;<br><br>John sighed. &#x201c;The only one of us who ever quit,&#x201d; he said to Charles, &#x201c;and he&#x2019;s the one everyone asks for in a crisis.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the ghost said, shaking his head. &#x201c;Ye be John, I think. Ron John Tollers, unless I miss my guess.&#x201d;<br><br>John stepped back in surprise at hearing a mishmash of his nicknames. &#x201c;That&#x2014;that&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m he. Do I know you?&#x201d;<br><br>The ghost spread its arms and smiled. &#x201c;In another life, another time,&#x201d; he said, his voice weary, &#x201c;I was your friend Hank Morgan.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good Lord,&#x201d; said John, glancing again at Charles, who was equally stunned. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t even walk across Oxford without stumbling into an adventure.&#x201d;<br><br><i>The old saying about absence making the heart grow fonder is overrated</i>, John had thought to himself as he prepared to go out earlier that afternoon. <i>Absence doesn&#x2019;t do anything except create longing, and an ache that cannot be remedied until the waiting is through.</i><br><br>He and the other Caretakers of the <i>Imaginarium Geographica</i>, Jack and Charles, had been waiting for seven years for a chance to return to the Archipelago of Dreams. In earlier times, they had gone for longer periods without visiting, but there had been less urgency in those days&#x2014;and maybe that was what stirred John&#x2019;s unease. That, or the fact that they&#x2019;d been forbidden to return. <i>We never truly know we want something</i>, he thought, <i>until we&#x2019;ve been told we can&#x2019;t have it</i>. Or perhaps it was the dark days of war covering the earth that made him long for the escape of the magical lands in the Archipelago.<br><br>Whatever it was, the price they&#x2019;d had to pay for a victory in the future was steep. They&#x2019;d jumped forward in time and defeated a terrible enemy, before returning to the time where they were meant to be. But to ensure that the victory remained certain, they had to stay away from the Archipelago, so as not to risk changing the outcome that had already happened.<br><br>They hadn&#x2019;t realized how hard it would be to wait through most of the new Great War that had swept the Summer Country.<br><br>The Darkness of the shadows was hardest to bear. In those days when the shadows of the Dragons swept over all the Earth, John in particular struggled mightily against the impulse to act.<br><br>&#x201c;We <i>are</i> acting,&#x201d; Charles and Jack would remind him, &#x201c;and we have. By waiting. We know that this is a battle we have already won, John. We just need to do our duty&#x2014;and do nothing. Nothing but wait.&#x201d;<br><br>Now, however, the waiting was almost over. The clock had caught up with the past, and the future was about to become the present again. And they could finally return and fully take up their mantle again as true Caretakers.<br><br>John had put on his jacket and looked at himself in the mirror. He was finally feeling the years of his life&#x2014;and not just because of the Wars. He had now been a Caretaker for longer than he had not. It was one of the roles that defined him&#x2014;and yet it was still one of the greatest secrets he kept from all but a few. <i>Until</i>, he thought with a smile, <i>the new calling of Jack&#x2019;s comes to fruition. If that works, well ...</i><br><br>Everything could change. Everything.<br><br>He had kissed his wife and children good-bye and stepped out the door.<br><br>It was less than an hour later that he and Charles began their conversation with the Pirate Ghost of Magdalen College.<br><br>&#x201c;Hank!&#x201d; John exclaimed. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened to you? You look so ... so ...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Old?&#x201d; Morgan replied with a cackle. &#x201c;Two centuries of waiting will do that to a man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Waiting for what?&#x201d; asked Charles.<br><br>&#x201c;For you,&#x201d; the ghost replied simply. &#x201c;I was waiting for you, Good Charlie, and Ron John, and Jack-Jack the Giant Killer. I was waiting for the three of you.&#x201d; He narrowed his eyes. &#x201c;Where be Jack, anyroad?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s finishing a discussion,&#x201d; said John. &#x201c;We, ah, we weren&#x2019;t exactly expecting to see you, Hank.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And why should ye?&#x201d; Morgan retorted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve only been appearing in this same spot for two hundred years, give or take.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No need to be snappish,&#x201d; said Charles, &#x201c;but you never spoke to anyone before now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because no one has ever spoken t&#x2019; me!&#x201d; said Morgan. &#x201c;It only works if <i>you</i> speak first.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d; John said, clearly puzzled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve lost me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No time, no time,&#x201d; said Morgan, waving his hands. Then, he laughed, wheezing. &#x201c;Or just enough, I suppose. Yes&#x2014;it was just enough.<br><br>&#x201c;Listen to me,&#x201d; the ghost insisted with a new urgency in his voice. &#x201c;You must build the bridge. Shakespeare&#x2019;s Bridge. You can&#x2019;t get back without it. But the bridge won&#x2019;t work without a trump.&#x201d;<br><br>He stopped and pulled one of the familiar silver watches from a broad pocket. He flipped it open and grimaced. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told them,&#x201d; he murmured to himself. &#x201c;The loop should have closed.&#x201d;<br><br>Charles gripped John&#x2019;s shoulder, and looks of worry creased both men&#x2019;s faces. They were missing too many pieces of a far bigger picture here.<br><br>&#x201c;Hank,&#x201d; John began, &#x201c;perhaps if we&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You must build Shakespeare&#x2019;s Bridge,&#x201d; Morgan said again. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the only way! The only way for you to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>He stopped and looked down at his watch, which had begun ticking. &#x201c;Oh, thank God,&#x201d; he murmured as he adjusted the dials on the device. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve finally managed to make a new&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>In midsentence, Hank Morgan vanished.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh my stars,&#x201d; said John. &#x201c;What just happened here, Charles? What did we just see?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing we can sort out on our own,&#x201d; Charles replied as he looked around the courtyard. Morgan was indeed gone, and whatever his cryptic message had meant, it was apparently all they were getting. &#x201c;Hank&#x2019;s supposed to be joining us at dinner later at Tamerlane House, anyway. We&#x2019;ll just take it up with him then. Maybe it&#x2019;s some sort of joke. To welcome us back?&#x201d;<br><br>John shook his head. Whatever else the ghost was, it was no joke. The age, the hard years that weighed on their old friend, were real. And that meant the warning was too.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; he said, spinning away on his heel. &#x201c;Jack will be waiting for us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Jack asked his friends as he ushered them into his rooms. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened?&#x201d;<br><br>He knew by their demeanors that something was amiss. John went straight to the cupboard to fetch glasses for a drink, while Charles wearily draped himself in one of the chairs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure how to begin,&#x201d; Charles said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just say we&#x2019;ve been having a little chat with a ghost.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; said Jack, smirking, as John handed him a snifter of brandy. &#x201c;Which one?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Old Pirate,&#x201d; Charles replied. &#x201c;You know, the one that appears at the base of the tower.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good Lord,&#x201d; said Jack after a moment. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re serious, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quite,&#x201d; John said, sitting next to Charles, &#x201c;but that&#x2019;s just the start of it.&#x201d;<br><br>Over the next several minutes, and a round of drinks, John and Charles related to Jack their experience with the ghostly Hank Morgan. When they had finished, he sat back and rubbed his forehead.<br><br>&#x201c;Amazing,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;Two centuries is a long time to wait to deliver such a cryptic message.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I got the impression that&#x2019;s all he could give us in the time he had,&#x201d; John noted, &#x201c;relatively speaking, that is.&#x201d;<br><br>Charles rubbed his chin, deep in thought. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s more than that,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;He said it only works if we spoke to him first, remember? I think that ghost may not have actually been Hank, but some kind of avatar that could speak only when spoken to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A recorded message?&#x201d; asked Jack. &#x201c;And interactive, to boot? That&#x2019;s some trick.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; said John. &#x201c;Who else but Hank would have the skills to pull it off?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Manipulating space as well as time,&#x201d; Jack said, pacing the width of the room. &#x201c;Not too many, I think. Alvin Ransom, probably. Rappaccini&#x2019;s daughter, maybe. Verne. Bert. Possibly Kipling. That&#x2019;s about it. There are others, associates of the Cartographer, who might have the skills, but they wouldn&#x2019;t have the need to send a message so indirectly. Not now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Associates?&#x201d; Charles asked. &#x201c;You mean apprentices, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not necessarily,&#x201d; replied Jack. &#x201c;Several of them were, but others ended up joining with Burton&#x2019;s Imperial Cartological Society.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; Charles said as he leaned back in his chair, crossing his legs. &#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br><br>The Imperial Cartological Society had operated as a sort of shadow organization to the Caretakers Emeritis. Comprised of rejected Caretakers, former Caretakers, and those men and women of history who might have been Caretakers in another time and place, the Society was dedicated to spreading knowledge of the Archipelago of Dreams and all its secrets&#x2014;by any means possible.<br><br>It was only after the Society was subverted by the Shadow King that there was a split among its ranks, and the de facto leader, Sir Richard Burton, brokered a truce with the Caretakers.<br><br>The Society would not attempt to spread knowledge about the Archipelago without the involvement and approval of the Caretakers Emeritis. And in return the Caretakers, under Jack&#x2019;s supervision, agreed to start a formal educational program at Cambridge in order to begin creating a greater awareness of the Archipelago among those who proved worthy to know of it.<br><br>It was an imperfect alliance, and it was likely to go through a succession of growing pains. But a tentative peace was better than war&#x2014;and they had all already had more than enough of war.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just say it, then,&#x201d; John said, rising to his feet. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t we consider that this could be some sort of trick of Burton&#x2019;s? He&#x2019;s done it before.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack dismissed the question with a wave of his hands. &#x201c;Not using Hank, no,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And besides, he&#x2019;s sitting at the Caretakers&#x2019; table, so to speak. There&#x2019;s nothing he can gain through deception that hasn&#x2019;t already been offered to him on a silver platter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We can just bring it up with Hank when we get to Tamerlane House,&#x201d; Charles said, stretching as he rose to stand with his friends. &#x201c;After all, it can&#x2019;t be much of a crisis Hank was warning us about. Not if he had to go walking through two centuries just to deliver the message. Another day shouldn&#x2019;t matter that much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Speaking of walking,&#x201d; said Jack, &#x201c;we should start heading for the Kilns. That&#x2019;s where Ransom is expecting to take us through, and besides, I want to check in with Warnie and see if Mrs. Morris has shredded Magwich yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Morris?&#x201d; Charles asked. &#x201c;I thought your cat was a he.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Morris <i>was</i> a he,&#x201d; Jack replied, &#x201c;right up until the point she had kittens. It&#x2019;s been Mrs. Morris ever since.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have kittens? Charles asked. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t seen any.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, we don&#x2019;t let them roam the house,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;We keep them in the storeroom with that stupid talking shrub.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I really do appreciate you taking him on,&#x201d; Charles said apologetically. &#x201c;He and Michal were getting on horribly, and I had enough trouble with her already after I explained about the map tattooed on my back. Apparently, wives like to be consulted about that sort of thing.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack shrugged. &#x201c;Maybe I ought to put him at Cambridge,&#x201d; he mused, &#x201c;make him the centerpiece of the new Imperial Cartological Society. Sort of a living cautionary tale about what happens when an evil henchman turned green knight mismanages his chance at redemption.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does it really count as a secret society if everyone knows it exists?&#x201d; Charles asked.<br><br>&#x201c;As I have begun to plan it,&#x201d; said Jack, &#x201c;it is most def...</p><h2>The Language of Fire: Joan of Arc Reimagined</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Language of Fire</em> is a lyrical, dark, and moving look at the life of Joan of Arc, who as a teen girl in the fifteenth century commanded an army and helped crown a king of France.</strong> </p><p>This extraordinary verse novel from award-winning author Stephanie Hemphill dares to imagine how an ordinary girl became a great leader, and ultimately saved a nation.</p><p>Jehanne was an illiterate peasant, never quite at home among her siblings and peers.

Brian Seibert, a dance critic for <i>The New York Times</i>, begins by exploring tap's origins as a hybrid of the jig and clog dancing from the British Isles and dances brought from Africa by slaves. He tracks tap's transfer to the stage through blackface minstrelsy and charts its growth as a cousin to jazz in the vaudeville circuits and nightclubs of the early twentieth century. Seibert chronicles tap's spread to ubiquity on Broadway and in Hollywood, analyzes its decline after World War II, and celebrates its rediscovery and reinvention by new generations of American and international performers. In the process, we discover how the history of tap dancing is central to any meaningful account of American popular culture. This is a story with a huge cast of characters, from Master Juba (it was probably a performance of his in a Five Points cellar that Charles Dickens described in <i>American Notes for General Circulation</i>) through Bill Robinson and Shirley Temple, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and Gene Kelly and Paul Draper to Gregory Hines and Savion Glover. Seibert traces the stylistic development of tap through individual practitioners, vividly depicting dancers both well remembered and now obscure. And he illuminates the cultural exchange between blacks and whites over centuries, the interplay of imitation and theft, as well as the moving story of African-Americans in show business, wielding enormous influence as they grapple with the pain and pride of a complicated legacy. <i>What the Eye Hears </i>teaches us to see and hear the entire history of tap in its every step.</p><p>"Tap is America's great contribution to dance, and Brian Seibert's book gives us--at last!--a full-scale (and lively) history of its roots, its development, and its glorious achievements. An essential book!"<br>--Robert Gottlieb, dance critic for&nbsp;The New York Observer&nbsp;and editor of&nbsp;Reading Dance<br>&nbsp;<br>"Brian Seibert's&nbsp;What the Eye Hears&nbsp;not only tells you all you wanted to know about tap dancing; it tells you what you never realized you needed to know. Drawing on his massive research, Seibert follows the art through its roots, its vaudeville heyday, its forays onto Broadway and into Hollywood, its decline, its renaissance, and its dissemination beyond American shores.

He reveals the hidden ecological and social costs of a hamburger (as much as $200), and asks how we came to have markets in the first place. Both the corporate capture of government and our current financial crisis, Patel argues, are a result of our democratically bankrupt political system.</p><p>If part one asks how we can rebalance society and limit markets, part two answers by showing how social organizations, in America and around the globe, are finding new ways to describe the world's worth. If we don't want the market to price every aspect of our lives, we need to learn how such organizations have discovered democratic ways in which people, and not simply governments, can play a crucial role in deciding how we might share our world and its resources in common.</p><p>This short, timely and inspiring book reveals that our current crisis is not simply the result of too much of the wrong kind of economics. While we need to rethink our economic model, Patel argues that the larger failure beneath the food, climate and economic crises is a political one. If economics is about choices, Patel writes, it isn't often said who gets to make them. <i>The Value of Nothing</i> offers a fresh and accessible way to think about economics and the choices we will all need to make in order to create a sustainable economy and society.</p></p><p><p><b>Raj Patel</b>, the author of <i>Stuffed and Starved</i>, is an activist and academic who has been hailed as "a visionary" for his prescience about the food crisis.

May God us keep</p> <p>From Single vision, &amp; Newton&#x2019;s sleep!</p> <p>&#x2014;WILLIAM BLAKE, "Poems from Letters"</p> <p>If war is God&#x2019;s way of teaching Americans geography, recession is His way of teaching everyone a little economics.</p> <p>The great unwinding of the financial sector showed that the smartest mathematical minds on the planet, backed by some of the deepest pockets, had not built a sleek engine of permanent prosperity but a clown car of trades, swaps and double dares that, inevitably, fell to bits. The recession has not come from a deficit of economic knowledge, but from too much of a particular kind, a surfeit of the spirit of capitalism. The dazzle of free markets has blinded us to other ways of seeing the world. As Oscar Wilde wrote over a century ago: "Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing." Prices have revealed themselves as fickle guides: The 2008 financial collapse came in the same year as crises in food and oil, and yet we seem unable to see or value our world except through the faulty prism of markets.</p> <p>One thing is clear: The thinking that got us into this mess is unlikely to rescue us. It might come as some consolation to know that even some of the most respected minds have been forced to puzzle over their faulty assumptions. Perhaps the most pained admission of ignorance happened in a crowded room in front of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform when, on October 23, 2008, Alan Greenspan described the failure of his worldview.</p> <p>Greenspan was one of the acknowledged legislators of the world&#x2019;s economy over the past nineteen years in his role as chairman of the Federal Reserve. A card-carrying member of the free market brigade, he used to sit at the feet of Ayn Rand who, although largely unknown outside the United States, remains influential long after her death in 1982. Her 1957 book Atlas Shrugged, in which heroic business moguls fight the scourge of government officials and union organizers, has once again scaled the best-seller lists. Regarding altruism as "moral cannibalism," Rand was the cheerleader for an extreme free market libertarian school of thought, which she called "Objectivism." Drawn into her circle by this heady philosophy, Greenspan earned himself the nickname "the Undertaker" for his jolly demeanor and dress sense. When Greenspan chose a career in government, it was rather like a hippie joining the marines, a lapse that his former friends could never forgive. Despite this, Greenspan remained largely faithful to Rand&#x2019;s philosophy, continuing to believe that egoism would lead to the best of all possible worlds, and that any form of restraint would result in disaster.</p> <p>At the end of 2008, Greenspan was summoned to the U.S. Congress to testify about the financial crisis. His tenure at the Fed had been long and lauded, and Congress wanted to know what had gone wrong. As he began to read his testimony, Greenspan looked exhausted, his skin jowly and sagging, as if the vigor that once kept him taut had all been spent. But he came out swinging. In the first round, he took aim at the information he&#x2019;d been working with. If only the input had been right, the economic models would have worked, and the predictions would have been better. In his words,</p> <p>A Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of the pricing model that underpins much of the advance in derivatives markets. This modern risk management paradigm held sway for decades. The whole intellectual edifice, however, collapsed in the summer of last year because the data inputted into the risk management models generally covered only the past two decades, a period of euphoria. Had instead the models been fitted more appropriately to historic periods of stress, capital requirements would have been much higher and the financial world would be in far better shape today, in my judgment.1</p> <p>This is a garbage-in-garbage-out argument: The model worked just fine, but the assumptions about risk and data, based only on the good times past, were faulty and so the output was correspondingly wrong. Greenspan&#x2019;s nemesis on the panel, Henry Waxman, pushed him to a deeper conclusion, in this remarkable exchange:</p> <p>WAXMAN: The question I have for you is, you had an ideology, you had a belief that free, competitive&#x2014;and this is your statement&#x2014;"I do have an ideology. My judgment is that free, competitive markets are by far the unrivalled way to organize economies. We have tried regulation, none meaningfully worked." That was your quote. You had the authority to prevent irresponsible lending practices that led to the subprime mortgage crisis. You were advised to do so by many others. And now our whole economy is paying the price. Do you feel that your ideology pushed you to make decisions that you wish you had not made?</p> <p>GREENSPAN: Well, remember, though, what an ideology is. It&#x2019;s a conceptual framework with [sic] the way people deal with reality. Everyone has one. You have to. To exist, you need an ideology. The question is, whether it is accurate or not. What I am saying to you is, yes, I found the flaw, I don&#x2019;t know how significant or permanent it is, but I have been very distressed by that fact.</p> <p>WAXMAN: You found a flaw?</p> <p>GREENSPAN: I found a flaw in the model that I perceived is the critical functioning structure that defines how the world works, so to speak.</p> <p>WAXMAN: In other words, you found that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working.</p> <p>GREENSPAN: Precisely. That is precisely the reason I was shocked, because I had been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well.</p> <p>The flaw, to be clear, wasn&#x2019;t a minor one of shoddy data. Nor was it the bigger Black Swan problem that writers like Nassim Taleb discuss, a problem of failing to account for highly unlikely events that, should they happen, involve catastrophic consequences. Greenspan&#x2019;s flaw was more fundamental still. It warped his view about how the world was organized, about the sociology of the market. And Greenspan is not alone. Larry Summers, the president&#x2019;s senior economic advisor, has had to come to terms with a similar error&#x2014;his view that the market was inherently self-stabilizing has been "dealt a fatal blow.&#x2019; "2 Hank Paulson, Bush&#x2019;s treasury secretary, has shrugged his shoulders with similar resignation. Even Jim Cramer from CNBC&#x2019;s Mad Money admitted defeat: "The only guy who really called this right was Karl Marx.&#x2019; "3 One after the other, the celebrants of the free market are finding themselves, to use the language of the market, corrected.</p> <p>The extent of Greenspan&#x2019;s admission has passed most of us by. If you trawl the op-ed pages of the financial press, you&#x2019;ll find plenty of analysis that fits Greenspan&#x2019;s first gambit, with pundits offering stories about how risk was incorrectly priced (which it was), how the lack of regulation allowed the panic to feed back into the financial system (which it has), how the incentive structures rewarded traders who were able to push financial risk far into the future (which they did) and how free market ideologues removed the sorts of circuit-breaking policies that might today have helped (and they did that too). But these are all it-could-have-been-fixed-if-we&#x2019;d-planned-better responses. I am not sure that we&#x2019;re able to comprehend what Greenspan&#x2019;s admission might really mean for us. It would be too big a shock to have the fundamentals of policy in both government and the economy proved wrong, and to have nothing with which to replace them.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s as if one day, you were to wake up and find yourself transformed into a cockroach.4 This is the premise of Franz Kafka&#x2019;s novella Metamorphosis. In the first sentence, a young salesman named Gregor Samsa wakes up, after a night of bad dreams, to find that he has turned into an enormous bug. Gregor Samsa&#x2019;s response is revealing, telling us a little bit more about ourselves than we&#x2019;d like. For what does Samsa do when he discovers he&#x2019;s a bug? He doesn&#x2019;t scuttle from his room screaming, or ponder how this happened, or what his transformation means, and what he might become tomorrow. His response is essentially this: "Poor me! How am I going to keep my job?"</p> <p>Which is almost exactly how we&#x2019;ve reacted to this economic crisis.</p> <p>While no one has yet woken up in the body of a bug, we have all found ourselves in a world turned upside down, where everything we were told was to our advantage has turned out to be its opposite. Greenspan&#x2019;s "flaw" has profound repercussions&#x2014;to understand it fully would mean a complete reappraisal of the way we conduct our lives. We would need not only a new way of mooring our expectations of our society and our economy, one based on richer assumptions about human nature, but also a different ideology governing the exchange of goods and services.</p> <p>Prices do some heavy ideological lifting in Greenspan&#x2019;s world. They provide a way to see and know the collective wants and resources of our small planet. This is Friedrich Hayek&#x2019;s economic philosophy, in which prices are the tendrils through which wants and needs are communicated. Science fiction fans will already be familiar with what this looks like. In The Matrix, liberated humans (and the programs who hunt them) can see the world in its raw form, as a digital rain of symbols and signs. This is the science fiction that governs economic fact. Data pelting down monitors is what the masters of the universe on the global financial exchanges stare at, their eyes darting from screen to screen, trying to see through the world and profit from it. In The Matrix, the signs were a simulation of the real world, hiding more than they revealed. The trouble is that this unreliable digital ticker tape has now become a central prop in the drama of modern commerce.</p> <p>Consider the fate of Volkswagen, which at the end of October 2008 managed briefly to become the world&#x2019;s most valuable corporation without having to sell a single vehicle. With the economy still in free fall, traders on stock-market floors were taking a dim view of Volkswagen. They looked at their screens and concluded that, just like every other auto manufacturer, Volkswagen was heading for tough times. Imagine you&#x2019;re a trader who feels in your bones that the stock price can only fall. One way to cash your hunch in is to sell Volkswagen stock today, and buy it back when the price falls. Since you don&#x2019;t walk around with Volkswagen stock falling out of your pockets, you&#x2019;ll turn to someone who does, like an institutional investor. You borrow their stock, for a price, and promise to return all of it very soon. The institutional investor is happy because they make money from lending out the stock, which they will get back in one piece. You&#x2019;re happy because you can sell this stock, wait for the price to fall, buy it back and, with the profit, not only pay back the institutional investor, but make the next installment on your yacht in Monaco. This practice is called "shorting."</p> <p>The trouble was that Volkswagen&#x2019;s rival, Porsche, had started quietly buying Volkswagen stock, aiming to secure 75 percent of the company. When the scale of Porsche&#x2019;s buying spree came to light, it became rapidly clear that there was little of the company left to trade. With Porsche sucking up all the shares, the price for Volkswagen didn&#x2019;t drop. Traders were selling borrowed stock to Porsche, and when Porsche announced its intentions to hold the stock, traders panicked. This led to a "short squeeze," a flocking of investors looking to cover the ill-conceived bets that they&#x2019;d paid for with stock that they didn&#x2019;t own. They&#x2019;d wagered that Volkswagen&#x2019;s price, like that of any other car company in a recession, would fall. When it became clear that even if Volkswagen wasn&#x2019;t doing well in the car market, its share price was nonetheless defying gravity, the speculators rushed to buy before the price went any higher.</p> <p>Their combined purchases drove the price of shares up further. So high did the price rise that Volkswagen entered the DAX 30 index of the largest corporations on the German bourse. This triggered another buying spree, driven not by stock-market gamblers, but by their polar opposites&#x2014;conservative institutional investors. Pension funds, for instance, invest with an eye to long-term returns; they prefer a slow and certain accumulation of wealth rather than risky bets. One way that they keep their portfolio on an even keel is to buy shares in nothing but blue chip corporations, ones that are guaranteed to be least susceptible to the shocks that stocks are heir to, ones that are in the top, say, thirty corporations traded in the open market. When Volkswagen joined the ranks of the DAX 30, a flock of institutional investors automatically wanted in. So they bought Volkswagen shares at whatever price they could find them. The result? The price per share went from &#x20ac;200 to &#x20ac;1,000 in a week&#x2014;an increase in company value of &#x20ac;300 billion (�244 billion; $386 billion). It made Volkswagen, briefly, bigger than Exxon-Mobil (with a book value of a mere $343 billion). And for this, the company didn&#x2019;t raise a finger.</p> <p>In the end, the rules on the DAX were changed, the price settled down and, in 2009, Volkswagen bought Porsche. It is easy enough to tell this story as one where institutional investors got caught with their pants down, where there was imperfect information about the size of the market, where the rules of different short-run and long-run games tangled. But look more closely. Underwriting this version of the story is a conceptual structure that lies beneath every story of excess and crash. The very notion of a bubble relies on the premise that when the bubble pops, things return to a normal state, a situation of price reflecting value more accurately. This is the story told after every boom and bust, from the South Sea Bubble of 1720 to the housing catastrophe of 2008. There&#x2019;s a widely shared opinion that normality will ultimately return to the world economy&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s a consensus view that rests on a story where bubbles are exceptions to the standard (and successful) procedures of market valuation. If those procedures themselves were flawed, as Greenspan suggests, then our faith in a gentle return to earth is misplaced, for there is and never has been any solid ground beneath our feet.</p> <p></p> <p>Excerpted from The Value of Nothing by Raj Patel.<br>Copyright � 2009 by Raj Patel.<br>Published in January 2010 by Picador.<br>All rights reserved.

Certainly not so late in the evening.<br><br>From the kitchen, Michael heard the scrape of silverware against plates, the opening and closing of the refrigerator as Angela put the leftovers away in preparation for Michael doing the dishes. It was their usual, long-agreed-upon routine for nights when she cooked.<br><br>Then the doorbell rang. At first the sound was so small, so distant and surprising, that Michael decided he'd imagined it. An auditory hallucination. Maybe two glasses clanked against each other in the kitchen, and he just thought it was the doorbell.<br><br>But then the bell rang again. Two times in a row. An insistent ringing, a sound that said someone outside meant business about getting their attention.<br><br>Angela appeared in the kitchen doorway. Her hair was pulled back off her face, and she held her hands away from her body as though they were wet or dirty.<br><br>"Who is that?" she asked.<br><br>"I'm not expecting anyone."<br><br>"Can you get it? My hands are dirty."<br><br>"I've got it," Michael said. He looked at his watch. Eight sixteen. "Probably a kid selling something."<br><br>"A determined kid, apparently," Angela said as the bell chimed again. She smiled. "They must know who they're dealing with."<br><br>"What's that supposed to mean?" Michael held back a laugh as he said it. He knew exactly what Angela meant.<br><br>"They know you're an easy mark," she said. "You always buy from them. Candy bars, magazines. They love you."<br><br>"Should you go answer, then?" he asked. "You can be the bad cop, and I'll watch baseball."<br><br>"I don't mind what you do," she said, smiling wider. "I like that these kids know how to push your buttons."<br><br>"Admit it. You don't mind eating the chocolate I buy."<br><br>"Touche."<br><br>Michael started for the door.<br><br>"Hey," Angela said, stopping him. "Did you call your sister yet?"<br><br>"Not yet."<br><br>"Don't forget, okay? This is a big deal. Lynn's coming up on five years cancer free."<br><br>"I know, I know. You sent flowers, right?"<br><br>"Yes. But you still need to call. It will mean a lot to her."<br><br>"I will. I promise."<br><br>Michael felt light as he walked to the front of the house. He looked forward to watching some of a baseball game or maybe reading a book. He felt encouraged as he reflected on the continued good news about Lynn's health. Next week, he and Angela were going away, a trip to St. Simons Island, just the two of them. Summer was good. Languid. Less work. If they relaxed more, if they got the time away, maybe they'd finally have luck in their ongoing struggle to have a child.<br><br>If not, he wasn't sure how things would play out. He and Angela were both feeling the strain, the weight it was adding to their marriage. He hated that sex had become a chore, a duty to be performed with the specific goal of producing a baby. Michael so wanted to get back to normal.<br><br>Michael entered the foyer and opened the front door. The sun was dropping, the horizon orange and hazy with the heat that brushed across his face. Someone was grilling, the rich odor of sizzling meat reaching his nostrils.<br><br>It took him a moment to comprehend the reality of the figure on his porch. She paced from one side to the other, a cigarette in her mouth, arms crossed.<br><br>He couldn't find the words. He didn't know the words.<br><br>So he just said, "What the hell?"<br><br>She stopped pacing, removed the cigarette. She looked scared, haunted. Her eyes wide and flaring. "I need you, Michael. I need your help."<br><br>"I don't understand. Why are you even here?"<br><br>She took a step toward him, gesturing with the hand that held the burning cigarette. Michael caught a whiff of the smoke, leaned back as the cigarette came closer to his body.<br><br>She dropped it on the porch. The ash sparked as it hit the ground.<br><br>"I just need your help, Michael."<br><br>"You need to back up, Erica. You need to-you need to leave."<br><br>"Michael. My daughter. Someone kidnapped my daughter this morning."<br><br><b>Chapter 2</b><br><br>"What is it, Michael?" Angela called from the kitchen. "Chocolate? Magazines?"<br><br>"I've got it," Michael said, his voice hollow and barely audible.<br><br>Michael moved onto the porch, pulling the door shut behind him. Erica stepped back, allowing Michael room. She started digging in the pocket of her jeans, which were dark and fitted, and brought out more cigarettes. While she shook one loose from the pack and flicked her thumb against the lighter, Michael took her in, observing the changes ten years had etched on his ex-wife. Some lines had formed around her eyes, some skin hung looser beneath her chin, but her shoulder-length hair showed no gray, and the cut looked more stylish and professional than the messy ponytail she had preferred in college. Michael noticed the gray Apple Watch on her wrist, the smartphone tucked in her pocket.<br><br>She looked like a grown-up. An adult. And the difference was striking.<br><br>She took a long drag on the cigarette and blew the smoke away from Michael. "You never liked this habit. I'd given it up until about twelve hours ago."<br><br>"What do you mean, your daughter?" Michael asked. "You have a daughter? How old is she?"<br><br>Erica's hand shook as she held the cigarette between her index and middle fingers. "Felicity. That's her name. Felicity."<br><br>"Your favorite show," Michael said, remembering. Erica coming to his dorm room after class, sprawling across his bed, her shoes kicked off, catching reruns of Felicity. She loved to analyze and debate the character's choices of men, wailed in distress when an episode played in which Keri Russell's hair was cut short.<br><br>Michael remembered it all. The late nights with friends in college. The drinking and the partying. Their histrionic fighting and the ensuing make-up sex.<br><br>The day of their wedding. And also the day a year later when he left.<br><br>All of it so long ago. When he looked back on that time, he thought they had both acted like children.<br><br>"None of this makes sense, Erica. I haven't seen you in ten years. I'm married."<br><br>"I know."<br><br>"You know? You can't just show up at my door like this."<br><br>"There's a man." She started pacing again, lifting the cigarette to her mouth, the tip glowing the same color as the sky while she dragged. "He's a music teacher at her school. He's odd. I think he liked her. Felicity. In an unhealthy way-you know? This man knows something."<br><br>Her words became more and more clipped, her gestures more frantic as she spoke. Ash fell off the cigarette and hit the concrete porch. Even when things had been at their best between them-many days in college, the early months of their marriage-Erica tended toward exaggeration. She had always managed to turn even the smallest misunderstanding-either with him or with someone else-into an operatic blowup.<br><br>Michael reached out, placed a hand on her arm. "Stop, Erica. Just stop and slow down."<br><br>She did. She looked at his hand where it held her arm near the crook of the elbow, his skin touching her skin for the first time in a decade.<br><br>Michael let go. But he said, "If someone you know is in trouble, you need to call the police. They can figure it out. I have to work tomorrow."<br><br>Erica paused for a moment. She dropped the cigarette, ground it under her sneaker, a new running shoe, and scuffed her foot, leaving a smear of dark ash across the concrete. Erica had run cross-country in high school, jogged three to five miles a day in college, even on mornings after late nights of partying. She'd always been energetic, almost frantic when she did anything-walking, studying, talking, having sex. She looked at Michael as if he didn't understand something fundamental. "The police are looking. They've been looking all day. Do you know what happens if they don't find someone right away? Do you know what happens to the missing person? The child?"<br><br>"Erica-"<br><br>"I've been talking to the police constantly, answering questions about me and my finances and my personal life and everyone I've ever known. Including you."<br><br>"Me?"<br><br>"Everyone. Everything about my life. They look into everything when a child disappears. I've had to answer the most embarrassing questions. The most personal questions."<br><br>Michael took a step back. He reached behind him, his hand fumbling for the doorknob. Baseball, he thought. A good book. Michael craved those things. And needed to get back to them.<br><br>To his real life. Not somebody else's.<br><br>He saw a wasp's nest in the corner of the porch, where a support post met the roof. He had been supposed to knock the nest down the weekend before, but he hadn't, even though a wasp had managed to get inside and zip around the kitchen, throwing itself against the window above the sink until Angela swatted it with a magazine. The nest was bigger now. More wasps stirred, floated above their honeycombed dwelling. The odor of the cooking meat grew stronger as the wind shifted. The sky was transitioning from the day's blue to the evening's purple.<br><br>"You should go talk to them," he said. "The police. Go back to them. Listen to them. Tell them whatever they want to know. You were never one to keep secrets, so tell them anything that might help. I'm just a guy you don't know anymore. I can't help you."<br><br>Erica stared him down. While she did, her eyes filled with tears. She bowed her head, an exaggerated gesture like she was praying. The movement took him right back to their college days, to times she was upset and times they fought. In both the past and the present, the gesture reached something in Michael, summoning empathy and concern for the person before him. Erica could look so vulnerable at times, she seemed always to feel more deeply than anyone else. It hurt to look at her when she was in pain or distress.<br><br>And then she glanced up again, the tear-filled eyes meeting his. Her chin quivered.<br><br>"You have to help me, Michael. You have no real choice."<br><br>Her tone of voice had shifted. Gone was the manic edge, the revved-up energy. Erica sounded shaken, scared.<br><br>She spoke again, her voice just above a whisper.<br><br>"She's yours, Michael. Felicity is your daughter, and I need your help getting her back."<br><br><b>Chapter three</b><br><br>"That's not possible-"<br><br>The door opened behind Michael. His hand still rested on the knob as it moved, so he let go. It was Angela. She took in the scene with her lips parted, struggling to find something to say just as Michael had moments earlier.<br><br>Finally, Angela said, "Is something wrong, Michael?"<br><br>Erica stood with her hands on her hips, her chin thrust forward in a defiant posture. But she still had tears in her eyes.<br><br>Michael looked between the two of them, feeling a strange surge of embarrassment. He and Angela had once run into his high school girlfriend, Kayla McKee, whom he'd dated all during senior year. Michael had felt awkward then, fumbled through introductions in the middle of the grocery store, but Angela laughed about it on the way home, pointing out that Kayla had three kids in tow and another on the way. "She's a breeder," she'd said. "You could have had a whole litter with her by now."<br><br>That was before their trouble having a child had grown more desperate. But Angela always talked freely of her former boyfriends and lovers, mentioned them as casually as she mentioned a piece of clothing or a pair of shoes from her past.<br><br>But she didn't laugh on the porch, not when she saw Erica.<br><br>"Angela," Michael said, "this is . . . Erica. My . . . I don't think you've ever met."<br><br>"Hi," Angela said, nodding at Erica, her voice clipped. "It's nice to meet you. We thought it was kids selling something."<br><br>"I'm sorry, but I need to talk to him," Erica said. "It's important."<br><br>"Michael, is everything okay?" Angela asked, hands on hips in an unconscious imitation of Erica's posture.<br><br>"Can you just go back inside for a minute?" Michael asked. "I'm going to figure this out, and then I'll be right in. I promise."<br><br>"It's getting late," Angela said. She took one more long look, running her eyes the length of Erica's body. Then turned to go back through the still-open door.<br><br>Michael knew what Angela meant. She was ovulating. They needed to try. That night. And likely again the next morning. They had a plan.<br><br>"I know you don't like me," Erica said to Angela. "You've made that very clear."<br><br>Angela kept going, closing the door as she went inside.<br><br>Erica's words stood out. They sounded like they referred to something more than the moment on the porch or the predictable distrust between two women who had dated-and then married-the same man. Michael started to ask about her words but stopped himself. He had more important things to figure out.<br><br>He remembered what she'd said just before Angela came outside.<br><br><i>She's yours, Michael. Felicity is your daughter.</i><br><br>"Erica," he said, "I don't know what you're talking about or why you're saying it, but we don't have any children together. You know that. I'm not sure why you're showing up here, trying to throw my life into chaos."<br><br>Erica maintained her defiant posture. "We were having sex up until the end, Michael. Up until you left me. We weren't always careful. You'd reach for me in the middle of the night. I don't think either one of us was fully aware of what we were doing."<br><br>"She's ten years old?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"And you never told me about her? Come on, Erica. That's crazy."<br><br>"Don't do that, Michael. We're not married, but you still can't just act like I'm overreacting or hysterical. You've always done that, and it's never been fair."<br><br>Erica started fumbling in her pockets again. Michael thought she was reaching for another cigarette, but instead she brought out her shiny iPhone. She scrolled through, her finger swiping quickly, and then she turned the screen so Michael could see it.<br><br>A photo of a child. She was blond, like almost all the women in his family. Her cheeks were rosy, and in the photo, she stood in front of what looked like a barn, the red wooden boards cracked and peeling. A beautiful kid, yes.<br><br>But his?<br><br>"Don't you see it, Michael?" Erica asked. "The resemblance."<br><br>"She's blond. Lots of people in the world are blond. They're not all my kids. None of them are my kids."<br><br>"Look closer. Zoom in."<br><br>"Erica, I can't even . . . I mean, we've been trying for two years, and the doctor says I may not be able to father a child. So how could this girl-"<br><br>"Look."<br><br>Michael did as he was told. He remembered Erica's determination, her iorn will once something entered her mind. He used his thumb and forefinger to zoom in on the girl's face, the picture clear even as the light faded from the day. The action didn't reveal any more to his eyes. He still saw a cute blonde girl on an outing to the country, her cheeks flushed from a long run or the cold wind.<br><br>"I don't get it, Erica. A photo doesn't prove anything."<br><br>"Robyn," Erica said. "Doesn't she look a lot like Robyn?"</p><h2>The Photographer&#39;s Vision Remastered</h2><p><b>Understand the greatest minds in photography.</b><br>In <i>The Photographer's Vision</i>, international bestseller Michael Freeman examines the work of photography's greats, explaining how to look at a photo - and how to learn from looking at it.

Before him, standup was about everything but hard news and politics. In his wake, a new generation of smart comics emerged--Shelley Berman, Mike Nichols and Elaine May, Lenny Bruce, Bob Newhart, Dick Gregory, Woody Allen, and the Smothers Brothers, among others. He opened up jazz-inflected satire to a loose network of clubs, cut the first modern comedy album, and appeared on the cover of <i>Time</i> surrounded by caricatures of some of his frequent targets such as Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Adlai Stevenson, and John F. Kennedy. Through the extraordinary details of Sahl's life, author James Curtis deftly illustrates why Sahl was dubbed by Steve Allen as "the only real political philosopher we have in modern comedy."<br><br>Sahl came on the scene the same year Eisenhower and Nixon entered the White House, the year <i>Playboy</i> first hit the nation's newsstands. Clad in an open collar and pullover sweater, he adopted the persona of a graduate student ruminating on current events. "It was like nothing I'd ever seen," said Woody Allen, "and I've never seen anything like it after." Sahl was billed, variously, as the Nation's Conscience, America's Only Working Philosopher, and, most tellingly, the Next President of the United States. Yet he was also a satirist so savage the editors of <i>Time</i> once dubbed him "Will Rogers with fangs."<br><br>Here, for the first time, is the whole story of Mort Sahl, America's iconoclastic father of modern standup comedy. Written with Sahl's full cooperation and the participation of many of his friends and contemporaries, it delves deeply into the influences that shaped him, the heady times in which he soared, and the depths to which he fell during the turbulent sixties when he took on the Warren Commission and nearly paid for it with his career.<br></p><p><p>The story of the comic who took the stage with nothing but a newspaper and gave America an entirely new way to laugh</p>James Curtis, Brea, California, was a senior executive in the health care and computer industries before turning full-time to writing.

His original blend of naturalistic landscape paintings with science-fiction elements and a very low-key recollection of growing up in the &#x2019;80s struck a chord, not just in Sweden, but all over the world. The Verge, Wired, IO9, Scientific American, and The Guardian have all praised his work. But until late 2014, the only place you could watch his art was in digital form on the Internet. St�lenhag splits his time between a small cabin at M�lar�arna (the setting that inspires his work) and an apartment in Stockholm.Tales from the Loop is Sci-Fi Art Excellence: "St�lenhag was far and away my favorite sci-fi artist of 2015, and Tales From the Loop will show you why.

It was foolhardy. And it was glorious. When they retired, Terry Darlington and his somewhat saner wife Monica&#x2014;together with their dog, a whippet named Jim&#x2014;chucked their earthbound life and set out in an utterly unseaworthy sixty-foot canal narrowboat across the notoriously treacherous English Channel and down to the South of France. <br><br>Aboard the <i>Phyllis May,</i> you&#x2019;ll dive through six-foot waves in the Channel and be swept down the terrible Rh�ne. You&#x2019;ll meet the French nobody meets&#x2014;poets, captains, scholars, madmen; they all want to know the couple on the painted boat and their narrow dog. You&#x2019;ll visit the France nobody knows&#x2014;the backwaters of Flanders, the canals beneath Paris, and the forbidden routes to the wine-dark Mediterranean Sea. Aliens, trolls, gongoozlers, killer fish, and the walking dead all stand between our two-person, one-whippet crew and their goal: the ancient, many-towered city of Carcassonne.<br><br>A tale of travel, travail, dubious wine, a balky pump, and a boat built for only a few feet of water, this exuberantly inventive and hugely entertaining odyssey of the spirit, senses, and heart will enchant lovers of France, England, and all that lies between.</p><p>Terry Darlington was brought up in Pembroke Dock, Wales, during the war, between a flying-boat base and an oil terminal. He survived and moved to Staffordshire, where he founded Research Associates, an international market research firm, and Stone Master Marathoners, a running club. Like many Welshmen, he is talkative and confiding, ill at ease with practical matters, and liable to linger in pubs. He likes boating but knows nothing about it.<br><br>Following the publication of<b> Narrow Dog to Carcassonne</b>, Terry, his wife Monica, and their whippet Jim planned to sail the <i>Phyllis May</i> down the Intracoastal Waterway from Virginia to Florida&#x2014;an adventure which, should they survive it, will be the subject of their next book, <b>Narrow Dog to Indian River</b>, coming from Delta in 2009.<i>Chapter One</i><br><br><i><br>Moon River Stone to Westminster<br></i><br>On the floor of the Star Inn Jim was fighting to push his entire body inside a bag of pork scratchings. I could have had a dog that ate its dinner, a dog that barked and wagged its tail, a normal dog, a dog with fur. But the book said a whippet was the easiest dog and I had trouble enough already.<br><br>Whippets are hounds-miners' dogs, racers, rabbiters. They are very thin. On top they are velvet and underneath they are bald. They are warm and smell of buttered toast. They love every living creature to a rapture unless you are small and furry and trying to get the hell out of here. They like running the towpaths and thieving off fishermen; but fire up the engine, cast off the ropes, and it's the eyes, the betrayed eyes. So the narrowboat Phyllis May has a dog that hates boating.<br><br>We'll call him Gonzales, I had said, because he's fast, or Leroy because he's golden brown, or we'll have a dog called Bony Moronie. Good thinking, said Monica, and named him Jim. He's your dog, she said-you look after him. I read Your Dog Is Watching You, and Your Dog Will Get You in the End, and How to Stop Your Dog Behaving Like a Bloody Animal. Jim and I went to school on many dark evenings, but neither of us learned very much.<br><br>The door from the canal opened and it was Clive. Like most inland boaters, Clive looks like a pregnant bear. Got you, he shouted-greedy greedy, early drinkies, surprise surprise, make mine a pint. He sat down and slapped his pipe and his Breton sailor's hat on the table. Jim was ecstatic. Jim sees Clive and Beryl as part of our pack, who sometimes make their escape owing to my lack of leadership and poor attention to detail. But through his tracking skills we get them back, and How about some scratchings?<br><br>Are you nervous? asked Clive, pulling Jim out of his trouser pocket. Yes, I said. I'm worried about getting away from Stone. I might crash or fall in. People will be watching.<br><br>Clive has a Dudley accent, and a deep voice, as if he is saying something important. Beryl and I should never have encouraged you, he said. You are old, you've only got one eye, you are a coward and you can't jump. You're no good at anything useful. Monica ran your business while you wandered around being nasty to your customers.<br><br>By the end of the summer I'll be fine, I said. I can handle the fear-running a market research agency scared me stiff too. We had another pint, to handle the fear.<br><br>TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO A bunch of engineers met in a public house by a canal. They decided the size of the locks on the English canal system and then they had another round and started talking about girls. In the morning the secretary could not remember what had been decided, or indeed where he was, so to be on the safe side he chose the narrowest gauge mentioned in his notes, which was seven feet. That is how the English narrow lock was born, and the English narrowboat-the cigarette, the pencil, the eel, the strangest craft ever to slither down a waterway.<br><br>The five windows of the Phyllis May lit the towpath for the length of a cricket pitch. With her flat roof, fairground lettering, brasses and flowers, a traditional narrowboat has a louche charm, though sixty feet by seven is a preposterous shape. Clive and I stepped into the front deck and down to the narrow saloon. Panelling, armchairs, lamps and pictures-second class on the Orient Express. You live in comfort, and you live sideways.<br><br>Monica was curled on the sofa. Beryl folded her hands in her lap, in a cornflower stare. Clive stood in the middle of the saloon. We have news, he said-we are forsaking earthly things. We are selling our house and our possessions, giving what is left to the poor, and having a narrowboat built, on which we will live out our days. Ah the poor earthbound rabble, tramping their warren streets-for me the silver highway, the gypsy life: my companion the heron, lone sentinel of the waterways, my constituency the ducks, my gardens the broad valleys, my drawing room the public bar of the inn called Navigation. I've been trying to persuade the bugger for years, said Beryl.<br><br>But first we are going up the Bristol Channel with you on the Phyllis May, said Clive. But I am not going up the Bristol Channel on the Phyllis May, I protested. The Phyllis May is a canal boat. There are fifty-foot tides and the Severn Bore. We will finish up dashed through the window of Woolworths in Bewdley. I don't think there is a Woolworths in Bewdley, said Clive, but if there is I can pick up a CD of Felix Mendelssohn and his Hawaiian Serenaders. And next year when you go to France we will all put out to sea together, and sail across the Channel side by side.<br><br>I could feel my palpitations coming on. Clive, I said, narrowboats don't sail across the Channel. I was brought up by the sea. I remember the empty seats in school when boys drowned themselves. I might sail the Phyllis May to France if there were thirty Tommies to take back and it would tip the balance in the struggle for Europe. Otherwise it's the lorry, and a crane into Calais.<br><br>Let's have a drop more of that Banks's, said Clive-you know I have blue water experience. You mean we went out once from Padstow, said Beryl, in a cruiser, and nearly drowned. That was a trick of the tide, said Clive. But they warned you, said Beryl, they begged you, they called it the Maelstrom and you went straight into it. But we got back in, said Clive. Yes, said Beryl, we got back in.<br><br>Is this Old Speckled Hen a strong one? asked Clive-it tastes so smooth. The thing is you rope them up together side by side, so if one breaks a belt on the engine the other tows it out of the way of the tankers and car ferries. Piece of piss really. Clive, I said, you come from Dudley, you have been to sea once and you nearly didn't come back, and now you want to put at hazard the December years I could spend in the Star or watching Kylie Minogue on the box.<br><br>But narrowboats are like those toys, said Clive. The bottom is full of bricks so they roll back. What about that chap, I said, who built a narrowboat in Liverpool and set out across the Irish Sea? How did he do? asked Clive. No one ever found out, I said. Must have run into a maelstrom, said Clive. Is that single malt as good as you say it is? He sat back and smiled. Jim looked at him with eyes full of love. He had found a leader at last.<br><br>When I woke up the next morning, and I wished I had not woken up the next morning, I realized that I had agreed to sail an inland boat across the English Channel, roped up to a madman.<br><br>A CANAL LOCK IS A SIMPLE IDEA. YOU CLOSE the gate behind you and empty the water out at the other end and you sink down, and then you open the gates in front of you and sail away. Going up you fill the lock instead of emptying it. In real life locks are dark and slimy and foaming. They flood you and hang you by the stern. Often they don't work. But today I wound up the paddles in the lock gate with my new aluminium key without spraining my wrist, and when the lock was empty heaved on the beams and opened the gates without shouting for help. The Phyllis May mumbled out of the Star lock into the sunshine, Jim riding shotgun on the roof.<br><br>Friends and family waved. Pints were brandished in the sunshine and granddaughters wept. The swans that nest below the Star dipped their beaks and raised them in perfect time. Past the tower of St. Michael's, to drinking, and dancing, and waving, and tears, and coarse encouraging shouts. A Cunarder leaving New York, country style.<br><br>Under Aston lock the Trent valley falls away in spires and farms. It's like Ulysses, I said, whom I so closely resemble.<br><br>Come, my friends,<br>'Tis not too late to seek a newer world . . .<br>It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:<br>It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br>And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.<br>Your dog has jumped ship, said Monica, and is probably in Rugeley. And there is a corpse under the prop, so you'll have to go down the weed-hatch again.<br><br>WHEN MONICA AND I BOUGHT THE PHYLLIS May she was worn out, and we had her refurbished. We had not had a boat before and sometimes we would go down to the cut and lick her all over. We loved the gangling shape and the long windows, we loved the curve of the bow and the front deck where you could sit, and the teak and oak saloon running on and on into the galley. We loved the iron stove, the shower that worked, the little bedroom cabin, the warm engine-room. We held the grab-rail along the roof and walked the gunwale, trying not to fall in. I would stand on the back counter, leaning on the tiller, musing upon our boatyard manager's sins and on the follies of the yard before him.<br><br>But one day we found a boatyard we could trust and soon we sailed away, in shining grey and white and crimson, with primroses on the roof and a brass tunnel light at the bow, and our names on the engine-room in fairground lettering a foot high, and ran into the first bridge.<br><br>The Phyllis May is not right yet-no narrowboat is right yet. Lumps of metal drop into her bilges, or she leaks from the rear. Then I strip naked, grease myself all over, and hang upside down among the ironmongery, grunting and cursing. It is dark, it is wet, I freeze and I burn and I get stuck and we call out the boatyard anyway. I have gone all sweaty in my hair so let's talk about something else.<br><br>Jim lets me use his kennel as my office. I put my laptop on it and sit on the coal-box with my feet on Jim. The coal-box has Phyllis May painted on the front side and Kiss Me Again on the backside. Jim lies quietly under my feet, which is more than my secretary ever did, and sometimes he licks me behind the knees, and in forty years in business there was no chance of that. In pubs he is the cause of much wise country talk about lamping for rabbits, and is seen as the next best thing to a lurcher. The trouble is he camps everything up.<br><br>In Stone I fastened him outside the supermarket. When I returned he was in the arms of an old man in a cloth cap. Both were crying softly. I crept away. I came back and a crowd had gathered. In the middle lay Jim, pretending to be dead. Was this your dog? asked a lady.<br><br>On the boat I opened a bag of pork scratchings. Jim manifested himself at my knee. He sat down-Can I have a scratching? Then he lay down-Please can I have a scratching? Then he rolled on his back and waved his legs in the air-Please please can I have a scratching? Then he sat up and looked straight at me-What do you want me to do-sing 'Moon Fucking River'?<br><br>A cathedral of oaks to Fradley, and we moored at the end of the nave.<br>CALL ME MOZZA, SAID OUR NEW FRIEND IN THE cowboy boots, settling into my chair. Some people call me Mad Mozza, he added proudly. He was a sturdy young chap, maybe forty, with sandy hair and blue staring eyes. Cheers Mozza, I said, I'm Terry and this is Monica and you've met Jim. We're really grateful Mozza, said Monica-Terry loves that dog.<br><br>He stole Captain's bone, said Mozza, and ran away-Captain didn't stand a chance. Jim looked out of his kennel, his eyes wide-He begged me Your Honour, Steal my bone; he went down on his hands and knees. He was on the road, said Mozza, but he came to me. They come to me because I have The Power. Would you like a cup of tea? asked Monica. Er yes, said Mozza. I poured him half a tumbler of rum.<br><br>I know this boat, said Mozza-Starbuck. Billy Ishmael had her built-lived on her for ten years. Knows his boats, Billy. Very artistic. Carried him home twice from the Plum Pudding in Armitage. Goodness, said Monica-but we are really pleased with her shape, Mozza: the low line, the big windows, and we've kept the grey. The lettering on the engine-room is not bad, said Mozza-why Phyllis May? My mother, I said, rest her soul-she still comes back. They come back all right, agreed Mozza. We had another rum, to stop them coming back.<br><br>We just retired, I said, and we bought a little house and we bought the boat and we bought Jim. We keep crashing into things and running out of fuel and falling in and people shout at us and stick notes on the door. Maybe we started too late. It's a way of life, agreed Mozza. You've got to be born to it. To tell you the truth, at your age you would probably be better off in a home-you must be a menace to the navigations. You're right Mozza, I said, but you can't get the beer.<br><br>Click click, said Mozza. Pardon? I said. Click click, said Mozza, let the water in click by click. Oh yes, I said, that poor chap last summer, two locks behind us. The lock filled too fast, knocked overboard by the tiller, engine in reverse, cut to pieces. Wife, two kids. Click click, said Mozza. What's the hurry?<br><br>We want to go south to see if we can handle the big rivers, explained Monica. This year we want to go down to London and past the Houses of Parliament and up the Thames and along the Kennet and Avon Canal to Bristol. Next summer we want to go to Paris, and the summer after to Carcassonne. Never heard of it, said Mozza. It's in France, I said, right down the other end. It's sort of an adventure before it's too late. They say at our age you are at the end of vigour.</p><h2>Nurturing New Families: A Guide to Supporting Parents and Their Newborn Babies</h2><p>In this guide to mother- and baby-centered postnatal care, Naomi Kemeny explains in detail how to 'mother the mother' - by listening to what she needs and supporting her as she adapts to her new role. <br><br>This insightful book is both a useful guide to the work of a postnatal doula, and a must-read for anyone wanting to help a new family cope with those intense yet magical early days with a newborn.</p><p>Naomi Kemeny is a midwife, postnatal doula childbirth educator, based in Sussex, England.</p><h2>Already Dead (A Joe Pitt Novel)</h2><p>Those stories you hear?

He lives with his family in Los Angeles.I smell them before I see them. All the powders, perfumes and oils the half-smart ones smear on themselves. The stupid ones just stumble around reeking. The really smart ones take a Goddamn shower. The water doesn&#x2019;t help them in the long run, but the truth is, nothing is gonna help them in the long run. In the long run they&#x2019;re gonna die. Hell, in the long run they&#x2019;re already dead.<br><br>So this pack is half-smart. They&#x2019;ve splashed themselves with Chanel No. 5, Old Spice, whatever. Most folks just think they have a heavy hand at the personal scent counter. I close my eyes and inhale deeper, because it could just be a group of bridge and tunnelers in from Jersey or Long Island. But it&#x2019;s not. I take that second breath and sure enough, there it is underneath: the sweet, subtle tang of something not quite dead. Something freshly rotting. I&#x2019;m betting they&#x2019;re the ones I&#x2019;m looking for. And why wouldn&#x2019;t they be? It&#x2019;s not like these things are thick on the ground. Not yet. I walk a little farther down Avenue A and stop at the sidewalk window of Nino&#x2019;s, the pizza joint on the corner of St. Marks.<br><br>I rap on the counter with the ring on my middle finger and one of the Neapolitans comes over.<br><br>&#x2014;Yeah?<br><br>&#x2014;What&#x2019;s fresh?<br><br>He looks blank.<br><br>&#x2014;The pizza, what&#x2019;s just out of the oven?<br><br>&#x2014;Tomato and garlic.<br><br>&#x2014;No way, no fucking garlic. How &#x2019;bout the broccoli, it been out all day?<br><br>He shrugs.<br><br>&#x2014;Fine, give me the broccoli. Not too hot, I don&#x2019;t want to burn the roof of my mouth.<br><br>He cuts a slice and slides it into the oven to warm up. I could eat the tomato and garlic if I wanted to. It&#x2019;s not like the garlic would hurt me or anything. I just don&#x2019;t like the shit.<br><br>While I wait I lean on the counter and watch the customers inside the joint. The usual crowd for a Friday night: couple drunk NYU kids, couple drunk greasers, a drunk squatter, two drunk yuppies on an East Village adventure, a couple drunk hip-hoppers, and the ones I&#x2019;m looking for. There are three of them standing around the far corner table: an old-school goth chick, and two rail-thin guys, with impossibly high cheekbones, that have fashion junkie written all over them. The kind of guys who live in a squat but make the fashion-week scene by virtue of the skag they bring to the parties. Just my favorite brand of shitdogs all in all.<br><br>&#x2014;Broccoli.<br><br>The Neapolitan is back with my slice. I hand him three bucks. The goth and the fashion junkies watch the two NYU kids stumble out the door. They push their slices around for another minute, then follow. I sprinkle red pepper flakes on my slice and take a big bite, and sure enough it&#x2019;s too hot and I burn the roof of my mouth. The pizza jockey comes back and tosses my fifty cents change on the counter. I swallow, the molten cheese scorching my throat.<br><br>&#x2014;I told you not too hot.<br><br>He shrugs. All the guy has to do all day is throw slices in the oven and take them out when they&#x2019;re ready. Ask for one not too hot and you might as well be requesting coq au vin. I grab my change, toss the slice back on the counter and take off after the junkies and the goth chick. Fucking thing had garlic in the sauce anyway.<br><br>The NYU kids have crossed the street to cut through Tompkins Square before the cops shut it down at midnight. The trio lags behind about eight yards back, walking past the old water fountain with Faith, Hope, Temperance, Charity carved in the stone above it. The kids reach the opposite side of the park and keep heading east on Ninth Street, deeper into Alphabet City. Great.<br><br>This block of 9th between Avenues B and C is barren, as in empty of everyone except the NYU kids, their trailers and me.<br><br>The junkies and the goth pick up the pace. I stroll. They&#x2019;re not going anywhere without my seeing it. What they want to do takes a bit of privacy. Better for me if they get settled someplace where they feel safe, before I move in.<br><br>They&#x2019;re right on the kids now. They move into a dark patch under a busted streetlamp and spread out, one on either side of the kids and one behind. There&#x2019;s a scuffle, movement and noise, and they all disappear. Fuck.<br><br>I jog up the street and take a look. On my left is an abandoned building. It used to be a Puerto Rican community center and performance space, before that it was a P.S. Now it&#x2019;s just condemned.<br><br>I follow the scent up the steps and across the small courtyard to the graffiti-covered doors. They&#x2019;ve been chained shut for a few years, but tonight the chain is hanging loose below the hacksawed hasp of a giant Master lock. Looks like they prepped this place in advance of their ambush. Looks like they may be a little more than half-smart.<br><br>I ease the door open and take a look. Hallway goes straight for about twelve yards then hits a T intersection. Dark. That&#x2019;s OK. I don&#x2019;t mind the dark. The dark is just fine. I slip in, close the door behind me and take a whiff. They&#x2019;re here, smells like they&#x2019;ve been hanging out for a couple days. I hear the first scream and know where to go. Up to the intersection, down the hall to the right, and straight to the open classroom door.<br><br>One of the NYU kids is facedown on the floor with the goth chick kneeling on his back. She&#x2019;s already shoved her knife through the back of his neck, killing him. Now she&#x2019;s trying to jam the blade into his skull so she can split it open. The junkie guys stand by, waiting for the pi�ata to bust.<br><br>The other kid has jammed himself in a corner in the obligatory pool of his own fear-piss. His eyes are rolling around and he&#x2019;s making the high-pitched noise that people make when they&#x2019;re so scared they might die from it. I hate that noise.<br><br>I hear something crunchy.<br><br>The chick has the knife in. She gives it a wrenching twist and the dead kid&#x2019;s skull cracks open. She claws her fingers into the crack, gets a good grip and pulls, tearing the kid&#x2019;s head open like a piece of rotted fruit. A pomegranate. The junkies edge closer as she starts scooping out clumps of brain. Too late for that kid, so I wait a couple seconds more, watching them as they start to eat, and listening to the other kid&#x2019;s moaning go up another octave. Then I do my job.<br><br>It takes me three silent steps to reach the first one. My right arm loops over his right shoulder. I grab his face with my right hand while my left hand grips the back of his head. I jerk sharply clockwise, pulling up at the same time. I feel his spinal cord tear and drop him, grabbing the second one&#x2019;s hair before the first one hits the ground. The chick is getting up off the kid&#x2019;s corpse, coming at me with the knife. I punch the second junkie in the throat and let him drop. It won&#x2019;t kill him, but he&#x2019;ll stay down for a second. The chick whips the knife in a high arc and the tip rakes my forehead. Blood oozes from the cut and into my eyes.<br><br>Whatever she was before she got bit, she knew a little about using a knife, and still remembers some of it. She&#x2019;s hanging back, waiting for her pal to get up so they can take me together. I measure the blank glaze in her eyes. Yeah, there&#x2019;s still a little of her at home. Enough to order pizza and pick out these kids as marks, enough to cut through a lock, but not enough to be dangerous. As long as I&#x2019;m not stupid. I step in and she thrusts at me with the knife. I grab the blade.<br><br>She looks from me to the knife. I&#x2019;m holding it tightly, blood spilling out between my clenched fingers. The dim light in her eyes gets minutely brighter as something gives her the word: she&#x2019;s fucked. I twist the knife out of her hand, toss it in the air and catch it by the handle. She turns to run. I grab the back of her leather jacket, step close and jam the knife into her neck at the base of her skull, chopping her medulla in half. I leave the knife there and let her drop to the floor. The second junkie is just getting back up. I kick him down, put my boot on his throat and stomp, twisting my foot back and forth until I hear his neck snap.<br><br>I kneel and wipe my hand on his shirt. My blood has already coagulated and the cuts in my hand have stopped bleeding, likewise the cut in my forehead. I check the bodies. One of the guys is missing a couple teeth and has some lacerations on his gums. Looks like he&#x2019;s been chewing someone&#x2019;s skull. Probably it belonged to the clown I took care of a couple days ago, the one with the hole in his head who tipped me off to this whole thing. Anyway, his teeth aren&#x2019;t what I&#x2019;m interested in.<br><br>Both guys have small bites on the backs of their necks. The bite radius and size of the tooth marks make me take a look at the girl&#x2019;s mouth. Looks like a match. Figure she bit these two and infected them with the bacteria. Happens that way sometimes. Generally a person gets infected, the bacteria starts chewing on their brain and pretty soon they&#x2019;re reduced to the simple impulse to feed. But sometimes, before they reach that point, they infect a few others. They take a bite, but don&#x2019;t eat the whole meal if you get me. No one really knows why. Some sob sisters would tell you it&#x2019;s because they&#x2019;re lonely. But that&#x2019;s bullshit. It&#x2019;s the bacteria compelling them, spreading itself. It&#x2019;s fucking Darwin doing his thing.<br><br>I check the girl&#x2019;s neck. She infected the others, but something infected her first. The bite&#x2019;s been marred by the knife I stuck in her, but it&#x2019;s there. It&#x2019;s bigger than the others, more violent. In fact, there are little nips all over her neck. Fucking carrier that got her couldn&#x2019;t decide if it wanted to just infect her or eat her. Whatever, all the same to me. Except it means the job isn&#x2019;t done yet. Means there&#x2019;s a carrier still out there. I start to stand up. But something else; a smell on her. I kneel next to her and take a whiff. Something moves behind me.<br><br>The other NYU kid. Right, forgot about him. He&#x2019;s trying to dig his way through the wall. I walk over to him. I&#x2019;m just about to pop him in the jaw when he does the job for me and passes out. I look him over. No bites. Now normally I wouldn&#x2019;t do this, but I lost a little blood and I never got to eat my pizza, so I&#x2019;m pretty hungry. I take out my works and hook the kid up. I&#x2019;ll only take a pint. Maybe two.<br><br> The phone wakes me in the morning. Why the hell someone is calling me in the morning I don&#x2019;t know, so I let the machine get it.<br><br>&#x2014;This is Joe Pitt. Leave a message.<br><br>&#x2014;Joe, it&#x2019;s Philip.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t pick up the phone, not for Philip Sax. I close my eyes and try to find my way back to sleep.<br><br>&#x2014;Joe, I think maybe I got something if ya can pick up the phone.<br><br>I roll over in bed and pull the covers up to my chin. I try to remember what I was dreaming about so I can get myself back there.<br><br>&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t wanna bug ya, Joe, but I figure ya gotta be in. It&#x2019;s ten in the morning, where ya gonna be?<br><br>Sleep crawls off into a corner where I can&#x2019;t find it and I pick up the damn phone.</p><h2>Hikaru no Go, Vol. 12 (12)</h2><p>Hikaru's career as a professional Go player begins!

He grinned as the adrenaline that kicked in sent his thumping heart up into his throat. And grimaced as he acknowledged that missing a deer caught in the headlights was about the most excitement he'd had in a month of Sundays.</p><p>Breed had been ready to bust balls when he'd been appointed as one of six FBI special agents on the JTTF two years ago. For the first year, he'd posed as a graduate student in business, son of the governor of Wyoming, King Grayhawk.</p><p>Not that King had ever been a father to him. Breed's mother Sassy had been married to King when he was born, all right. But his father had taken one look at his supposed offspring's crow-black hair, odd silver-gray eyes, and copper-hued skin, named him Breed for the half-breed he appeared to be, and started divorce proceedings.</p><p>The truth would have been easy enough to prove with DNA, if anyone had bothered. But King was too proud, Sassy was too drunk, and Breed was too angry.</p><p>Nevertheless, in the name of patriotism -- and because it was the politically correct thing to do -- King had been persuaded by the FBI to allow Breed to use his wealthy father's oil connections and influence to help him get introductions to rich Saudi and Egyptian and Iranian sons attending UT, in hopes of uncovering an al-Qaeda operative.</p><p>It had all been for naught. As the San Antonio SAC had pointed out, the worst offenses Breed had rooted out were identity theft and bank credit card fraud. And those thieves had been strictly American. So much for heroically saving the country from foreign and domestic terrorism.</p><p>Breed likened his work with the JTTF to a shepherd watching his flock. The wolf might not come around for months at a time, but the shepherd had to remain vigilant. If he let down his guard, the wolf could -- and would -- slip in amongst the flock and slaughter them.</p><p>Breed hadn't told anyone the fanciful analogy he used to describe what he did for a living. But it kept him committed and made him feel his work was necessary and important. Especially when there hadn't been even the whiff of a terrorist threat in the two years since he'd become a member of the Austin JTTF.</p><p>He groused to his friend, Texas Ranger Jack McKinley, about the inaction and redundancy, and sometimes downright boredom, of his work. But he would never, ever abandon his watch for the wolf.</p><p>Which was why the meeting today with the San Antonio SAC had left him feeling antsy. Anxious. Like a creature that smells fire in the wind, sensing danger, ready to run, but unsure in which direction safety lies.</p><p>All his life, Breed had known when trouble was on the way. It was a survival mechanism, a sixth sense that warned him that his mother was headed into alcohol rehab again, and he was about to be pawned off on another relative.</p><p>Or that some lush she'd met in rehab and married didn't want her son around, so he'd better make himself scarce.</p><p>Or that she'd found a guy to pay a plastic surgeon to give her a new face and a more bosomy figure, and she would be leaving him with yet another distant relative, or even a "friend," while she went away to recuperate.</p><p>He'd survived being abandoned again and again by his mother. He'd even thrived. Because he always prepared himself for the worst, and therefore was never disappointed, no matter what happened.</p><p>He pulled into a spot in front of a ramshackle cowboy bar called Digger's and shut off his engine. He was hoping for a cold drink. And a warm woman. With any luck, he wouldn't be disappointed.</p><p>The heat of a sunny October day in South Texas had dissipated, but when Breed stepped inside Digger's, the smell of sweat hung in the air. And despite the national obsession with not smoking, a haze of burned tobacco clouded the turquoise-painted interior.</p><p>An old Waylon Jennings tune was playing on an equally ancient jukebox, forcing the voices inside Digger's up a notch, so twenty-five people sounded like forty. Everyone wore cowboy hats and belts and boots, and Wranglers like the Texas Rangers wore, with rivets in the right places and seams that didn't chafe on horseback.</p><p>Breed was a regular, and the bartender nodded at him and set an ice-cold and dripping bottle of Dos Equis beer in front of him on the scarred wooden bar.</p><p>By the time Breed said, "Thanks, Jimmy Joe," the bartender had already shuffled away to fill another order.</p><p>Breed stared into the mirror over the bar, which was crowned with a curving set of Longhorn steer horns that had to be ten feet from point to point. He'd purposely sat down next to the female at the end of the bar who looked shapely from behind. He felt his heart jump when she lifted her stunning blue eyes and met his gaze in the mirror.</p><p>The attraction was immediate. And powerful. He recognized it without giving in to it.</p><p>Breed didn't do relationships. Didn't believe in romantic love. Didn't believe in anything that ended happily ever after. It wasn't part of his experience. When he wanted a woman, like now, he found one willing to satisfy his needs. In exchange he offered mutual satisfaction -- or money. Nothing more.</p><p>He perused the woman beside him at his leisure, recognizing that she was pretty, rather than beautiful. Her eyes were too far apart and her nose was a little crooked, but her mouth looked very kissable, the lips full and pink without lipstick. Her complexion was unbelievably light and creamy, and he wondered if the rest of her was as smooth and touchable. She had straight black hair that fell halfway down her back. He was amused to find her staring boldly back at him in the mirror.</p><p>She was drinking tequila shots. One upside-down shot glass sat in front of her, and she was nursing a second glass that was half full. He felt a strong tug in his groin when she smiled at him in the mirror, revealing nearly perfect white teeth. She lifted her shot glass in a toast and tossed the rest of it down without making the sort of face females usually made when they drank straight liquor.</p><p>She turned the glass upside down and set it carefully on the bar without a sound. In a husky voice that felt like a warm hand caressing his flesh, she said, "Another one, Jimmy Joe."</p><p>Breed's body hardened like a rock. So much for subtle interest in the female sitting to his right. He was already imagining himself deep inside her when he felt her hand on his thigh. He jerked at the touch, but managed to hang on to his beer without spilling it as he turned to her, easing his leg free.</p><p>"I'm Grace," she said. "What's your name?"</p><p>Breed usually liked to do the chasing, but somehow he didn't mind getting caught by this particular she-wolf. "Breed Grayhawk," he replied.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, and he watched as she noted the copper hue of his skin, the high cheekbones and blade of nose, the narrow lips and chiseled chin. He felt himself flush when she nodded, acknowledging without a spoken word what his name likely meant.</p><p>Half-breed.</p><p>He was disconcerted when her inspection didn't stop with his face but drifted to the breadth of his shoulders, his lean waist, and -- he couldn't believe she was actually doing it -- the hard ridge in his jeans, before skimming down the length of his legs.</p><p>He didn't much like being sized up like a prize bull. So he gave her back what he'd just gotten, starting with her striking, wide-spaced blue eyes, a nose that should have been aquiline, but now had a bump that proved it had been broken once upon a time, and a mouth with lips so full they made a man wonder how they would feel in a lot of different places. The mouth was scarred, too, with a small white mark on the upper right edge.</p><p>Abusive husband? he wondered. Abusive father, maybe? Car accident, more likely. She had a self-possession that he couldn't make fit with a cringing victim.</p><p>She smiled, a bare curve of her lips he would have missed, except it was reflected as a twinkle in her blue eyes. Then she lifted a finely arched brow -- another barely-there scar slicing through the right edge of it -- to ask if he was done yet.</p><p>He wasn't.</p><p>Breed let his eyes follow the length of her neck to milky white shoulders and a pair of breasts that were amazing, if they weren't fake, outlined in a low-cut, lace-trimmed white sleeveless top. A narrow, cowboy-belted waist flared into the kind of hips that made a woman good at childbearing, and slender, jean-clad legs. He imagined them naked, wrapped around him, and felt his mouth go dry.</p><p>He couldn't believe the invitation he saw in her eyes when their gazes met again. He wondered for a moment if she was a hooker -- beat up by her john one too many times? -- and realized he didn't give a damn. He wanted her any way he could get her.</p><p>He hadn't noticed Jimmy Joe bringing her another drink, but she turned from him, licked some salt from her hand, drank half the shot glass of tequila, then bit into a slice of lime.</p><p>He felt that lick in the place he wanted it most. His whole body tensed, and he must have looked -- and smelled -- to her like some sort of beast in rut, because she glanced sideways at him before shoving her silky black hair back across her shoulder in a gesture that reminded him of a doe flicking her tail at a stag.</p><p>He glanced at the two shot glasses upside down in front of her and the third half-empty one and realized he didn't want her senses dulled any more than they already must be.</p><p>"What would it take to get you into bed?" he said in a low, guttural voice.</p><p>For the first time she looked less than supremely self-confident. "What?"</p><p>"How much to have you?"</p><p>Her eyes flickered with some emotion he couldn't name before she said in a cool voice, "More than you can afford, Cowboy."</p><p>"Name your price," he said, determined to have her, whatever it cost him.</p><p>"I don't want your money." She did a perusal of his body that made his blood feel like lava in his veins, then said, "I need a favor."</p><p>"Name it."</p><p>"After," she said. "Agreed?" She held out her small hand for him to shake.</p><p>Her grasp was surprisingly strong as he caught her hand in his own. "Sure." </p><p>"You won't back ...</p></p><h2>Martin Luther: A Spiritual Biography</h2><p><p>Famous for setting in motion the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther is often lifted high as a hero or condemned as a rebel. But underneath it all, he was a man of flesh and blood, with a deep longing to live for God.</p><p>This biography by respected Reformation scholar Herman Selderhuis captures Luther in his original context and follows him on his spiritual journey, from childhood through the Reformation to his influential later years. Combining Luther&#x2019;s own words with engaging narrative designed to draw the reader into Luther&#x2019;s world, this spiritual biography brings to life the complex and dynamic personality that forever changed the history of the church.</p></p><p><p><strong>Herman Selderhuis</strong> is professor of church history at the Theological University Apeldoorn in the Netherlands and director of Refo500, the international platform focused on raising awareness for projects related to the legacy of the Reformation. He also serves as the director of the Reformation Research Consortium, president of the International Calvin Congress, and curator of research at the John � Lasco Library in Emden, Germany.

Written by one of the most respected international scholars in Reformation history, this book may be fruitfully used as an introduction to Luther&#x2019;s life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Volker Leppin,</strong>&nbsp;Theologian and Professor of Church History, Eberhard Karls University of T�bingen; President, Interdisciplinary Medieval Association</p><p>&#x201c;With a keen eye for the details that make Luther come alive for twenty-first-century readers, and with an ear for those often-false rumors spread by other scholars about the man, Selderhuis guides us through the life of the Wittenberg professor, depicting his genius and his temperament within the context of his time and its challenges. This well-balanced journey at the reformer&#x2019;s side provides readers with insights into the development of his thought and his path toward prominence and influence that shaped the last quarter century of his life. The often-slighted later years, in which his writings and personality created a sphere of influence equaled by few in any age, are here given due attention, with helpful explanations of the setting in which Luther&#x2019;s reform movement matured.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Robert Kolb,</strong>&nbsp;Emeritus Professor of Systematic Theology, Concordia Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;The complexity of Luther is staggering, but Herman Selderhuis has given us a detailed portrait of the reformer that captures both his blemishes and the beauty of his faith in Christ. This book is a fascinating read about one of the most significant figures of history. Both students of Christian history and admirers of Reformation theology will find it helpful.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joel R.

With such a Luther-glutted market, what more could possibly be said about him? Well, this latest volume from the hand of the gifted Reformation scholar Herman Selderhuis does indeed give us a fresh perspective on the German reformer. With his own translations of Luther&#x2019;s writings and his comprehensive knowledge of Luther&#x2019;s world, both theological and social, this new biography is both deeply instructive about the things that mattered most to Luther and a delight to read. This is how biography should be written!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael A. G. Haykin,</strong> Professor of Church History and Biblical Spirituality, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Among the many new biographies of Martin Luther, this one stands out for its fresh engagement with Luther&#x2019;s own assessment of his life and work. Well researched and engagingly presented.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Timothy George,</strong>&nbsp;Founding Dean and Research Professor of Divinity, Beeson Divinity School, Samford University; general editor, Reformation Commentary on Scripture</p><p>&#x201c;What makes this Luther biography distinct is its explicit attention to Martin Luther&#x2019;s spiritual journey as a sixteenth-century person haunted by his demons and driven by his passions, and the way it presents Luther&#x2019;s own voice and reflection throughout, paired with a restrained but poignant analysis that invites the reader to dig deeper. Luther is introduced as a &#x2018;problem&#x2019; in his church context with evolving roles in which he is shaped by his relationships. He is assessed as a &#x2018;unique phenomenon&#x2019; on the one hand, while as a flesh-and-blood human being with a temperament, strong emotions, and tragic ailments on the other. Selderhuis&#x2019;s clearly written and immediately engaging narrative, with wit, offers an abundance of detail and apparatus for the reader to understand one of the most fascinating personalities in Christian history and the complexities of his Reformation hermeneutics.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Kirsi Stjerna,</strong> First Lutheran, Los Angeles / Southwest Synod Professor of Lutheran History and Theology, Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary; author, <em>Women and the Reformation</em></p><p>&#x201c;This richly illustrated and succinctly written book, based on anything but superficial knowledge, is very much a life of Luther for everyone. While announcing itself as a &#x2018;spiritual biography,&#x2019; it actually presents Luther in body and soul in his day-to-day contexts. Selderhuis catches very well Luther as a reformer stumbling daily from one unconcealed existential crisis to another, often beset with spiritual, mental, religious, family, political, physical, and personality problems. Here we have the real Luther&#x2015;potent prophet of God, astonishing theologian, prolific writer, and phenomenal communicator indeed, but also a flawed genius whose attributes included buffoonery, vulgarity, vindictiveness, and downright rudeness. While many have viewed the reformer as a Hercules of the faith and the thirteenth apostle, this book reminds us that Luther was also no saint and that he had no pretensions to be one.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>W.

Here is where to start your investigation of an amazing man whose remarkable courage, controversial ministry, and persuasive writings changed the world&#x2015;for good and for ill. Don&#x2019;t miss reading this fascinating, fun, and poignant foray into the spiritual life and tumultuous times of the one who, as Calvin described, &#x2018;gave the Gospel back to us.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Peter Lillback,</strong>&nbsp;President and Professor of Historical Theology and Church History, Westminster Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Martin Luther: A Spiritual Biography</i> offers a new and fascinating approach to Luther&#x2019;s life. In this book, political and theological contexts are paid attention to, but priority is given to the story of Luther&#x2019;s religious life, from childhood to old age. The account is based on an extensive use of primary sources&#x2015;not least Luther&#x2019;s letters and <i>Table Talk</i>&#x2015;and the reformer&#x2019;s own words are frequently quoted. At the same time, the interpretation of Luther&#x2019;s texts is closely related to specific places and concrete situations in his life. In this way, the reader is brought closer to Luther&#x2019;s person than what is often the case in other biographies.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Tarald Rasmussen,</strong>&nbsp;Professor of General Church History and Research Director, University of Oslo; editor, <em>Teologisk Tidsskrift</em></p><p>&#x201c;Herman Selderhuis is a fine scholar but also a churchman and a teacher. Thus, he writes with an enviable, conversational ease, which makes his teaching accessible to the nonspecialist audience. In this brief biography of Martin Luther, he brings the reformer alive, from his birth in humble circumstances to his death as the most (in)famous man in Europe. Those who have never encountered the narrative of Luther&#x2019;s life before will find this an accessible and satisfying introduction that wears its learning lightly and points to the deep truths to which Luther&#x2019;s life and thought testified.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Carl R.

Gareth Stedman Jones depicts an era dominated by extraordinary challenges and new notions about God, human capacities, empires, and political systems&#x2015;and, above all, the shape of the future.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, a Europe-wide argument began about the industrial transformation of England, the Revolution in France, and the hopes and fears generated by these occurrences. Would the coming age belong to those enthralled by the revolutionary events and ideas that had brought this world into being, or would its inheritors be those who feared and loathed it? Stedman Jones gives weight not only to Marx&#x2019;s views but to the views of those with whom he contended.

He anchors his narrative in a startlingly textured account of the society and politics of Marx's era.Most important of all, he brings to life the thoughts of a plethora of other writers, showing how Marx's engagements with the thoughts of others enabled him to navigate a course that often had little or nothing to do with the Marxism of the twentieth century.

Some of them like to say that the goddess Ani wrote the Great Book and made it so that ten men and women who loved stories would find copies of it at the same time. Some of them say a mere woman with ten children transcribed Ani&#x2019;s words over ten years. Others say some illiterate half-witted farmer wrote it in one night after Ani blessed him. Most believe that the Great Book&#x2019;s author was a mad yet holy, always always holy, prophet who&#x2019;d taken refuge in a cave.</p><p>What <i>I</i> can tell you is that two hundred years after it all went wrong an old man named Sunuteel was out in the desert. This man was one of those who enjoyed being out there for weeks on end, close to the sun, sand, and desert creatures. The time away from his wife made their time together sweeter. Sunuteel and his wife agreed on this. They were old. They had wisdom.</p><p>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; his wife said with a smile. She took his old rough hand into her equally rough old hand. She was a beautiful woman, and Sunuteel found it easy to look into her eyes. &#x201c;It is good,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I need the solitude.&#x201d;</p><p>There had been an especially powerful Ungwa storm and the old nomadic couple had barely survived the dry thundery night of lightning. A bolt had struck near their sturdy tent, setting on fire one of the three stunted palm trees they&#x2019;d camped beside. His wife had been peeking out of the tent when it happened. Thankfully, she&#x2019;d blinked at precisely the right moment. She said the tree looked like a woman dancing in flames. Even as Sunuteel dragged her to the center of the tent where they huddled and prayed, his wife felt a presence. She was sure it was a premonition.</p><p>The old man was used to his superstitious wife and her odd intuitions. Therefore, he knew his wife would want to be alone to think and ponder and fret. When the storm passed and she gently encouraged him to take a few days to go and see what was out there, he didn&#x2019;t argue. He took the rolled up goatskin tent and satchel of supplies she handed him and kissed her on the cheek. He didn&#x2019;t say goodbye because in his tribe &#x201c;goodbyes&#x201d; were a curse.</p><p>&#x201c;I leave my <i>chi</i> to keep you company,&#x201d; he said. Each night he was away, along with her meals, she&#x2019;d prepare a small plate of food for his personal god until Sunuteel returned. He clipped his portable to his hip, facing the tiny device inside his pocket. After one last, far more prolonged kiss, he walked away from his wife. Did she think an angel was coming to visit her? His wife&#x2019;s descendants were from the Islamic portion of Old Naija. She said that her father used to tell her all sorts of stories about angels and djinn. She&#x2019;d passed these magical stories on to their own children as they grew up.</p><p>Minutes after leaving, Sunuteel brought out his portable and laughing to himself, called up the virtual screen and typed, &#x201c;Hussaina, greet <i>her</i> for me when you see her, whether she&#x2019;s an angel or djinni.&#x201d; Moments later, his wife Hussaina&#x2019;s reply popped up on the screen saying what she always said when Sunuteel went off, &#x201c;And you make sure you bring me back a good story.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Two days later, Sunuteel came upon a cave full of computers. A tomb of old old technology from the Black Days, the Times of the Dark People, the Era of the Okeke. This was one of those caves into which panicked Okeke packed thousands of computers just before Ani turned her attention back to the earth. These computers were supposedly used to store huge amounts of information separate from digital repositories called virtual spaces. Little good this did; virtual or physical, it was all dead, forgotten, rotten.</p><p>&#x201c;What am I seeing?&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Can this be?&#x201d;</p><p>He pressed a shaky hand to his chest, feeling the strong heartbeat of his strong heart. Standing here, he didn&#x2019;t feel so old. No, not old at all. This place made him feel young as a babe. Sunuteel, who was Okeke and therefore a descendant of the evil that caused the goddess Ani to bring the deserts, knew of the poisonous Black Days and their most poisonous genius gadgetry. However, he had always wanted to see these ancient computers with his own eyes.</p><p>So, he went in.</p><p>The cave was cool and it smelled of dust, mineral oil, plastic, wires, and metal. There were ghosts here and Sunuteel shivered from the thought of them. Still, he approached these old machines. <i>This</i> was a story to tell his wife. The third computer that he touched sparked with life. Terrified, he snatched his hand from the &#x201c;on&#x201d; pad he&#x2019;d accidently brushed against and stumbled back. The grey hand-sized box, softly hummed. Then it spoke to the portable clipped inside the pocket of his dusty pants. The portable pinged softly as it wirelessly received a large file from the computer. Sunuteel blinked and then fled from the cave, sure a ghost had touched him.</p><p>When he made it back to his small goatskin tent beside a baobab tree, only then did he dare look at his portable. He held the coin-sized device in his palm and brought it to his face, for his eyesight was poor. He squinted at the tiny screen. Next to the file that contained messages from his wife was a black icon in the shape of a bird that seemed to be looking over its shoulder. He tapped it with the tip of his finger and a deep male voice began to speak in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. English!</p><p>It was an audio file. Sunuteel sat back in his tent, grinning with delight. <i>My goodness</i>, he thought. <i>How strange. What are the chances?! </i>He <i>knew </i>this dead language, albeit the accent was very odd, indeed. He brought up the virtual screen. The visual words that appeared as the audio file played were tinted red instead of the usual green. He put the portable on the blanket before him. Then he watched and listened.</p><p>The voice read a table of contents as it digitally projected the words on the virtual screen in front of him:</p><p>&#x201c;Section one, mythology. Section two, legend. Section three, mechanics. Section four, news&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>He frowned as it read on and on. After a while, he decided to click on &#x201c;Section thirty-eight, memory extracts&#x201d; because the phrase rung a distant bell from when he was a child. In school, the teacher had spoken about the dark times hundreds of years ago, when human beings were obsessed with the pursuit of immortality. They had even found a way to pull out and capture people&#x2019;s memories right from their minds so they could preserve them forever. &#x201c;Just like a capture station sucking condensation from the sky to make drinking water,&#x201d; his schoolteacher had said.</p><p>Sunuteel had been fascinated and quietly proud of just how <i>far</i> human beings had gotten in their technological pursuit. Nevertheless, his schoolteacher had discouraged him from further research. &#x201c;Sunuteel,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This was what led us to receiving Ani&#x2019;s wrath.&#x201d;</p><p>And so the young Sunuteel turned away from the past and looked mostly toward the future. He loved language, words and stories. He&#x2019;d gone on to become one of his village&#x2019;s most valued recorders and reciters. He could recite the most beautiful poetry in five different dialects of flawless Okeke, but also in the language and various dialects of the majestic and mighty Nuru people and the common language of Sipo. And most amazingly, one of the prominent village elders had been able to teach him English, too.</p><p>As far as Sunuteel knew, this elder, an old-timer in Sunuteel&#x2019;s village who&#x2019;d always been called The Seed, was the only person who knew the language. The Seed was also the only light-skinned person in his village who was not albino. This man refused to call himself Nuru, insisting that he was &#x201c;Arab,&#x201d; a term that had long become more an insult than an ethnic description of the Nuru people. The Seed preferred to live amongst the Okeke, the dark-skinned woolly-haired people. He&#x2019;d built a house in front of one of the pyramids because it reminded him of home. When Sunuteel was a teen, The Seed looked no older than fifty, but Sunuteel&#x2019;s mother said he was actually much older.</p><p>&#x201c;He looked the exact same when I was a little girl,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told him. She was right. Even now that Sunuteel was an old old man, The Seed still looked no older than fifty. Sunuteel was of a people who understood that the world was full of mystery. Thus, a seemingly immortal man living in the village didn&#x2019;t bother anyone. The Seed had an amazing command of the English language and though he was moody and reclusive at times, he turned out to be a wonderful teacher.</p><p>Sunuteel went on to read the only two English texts in the entire region, both of which were owned by the Seed. One was an anthropology book titled <i>Virulent</i> <i>Diseases of the Mars Colonies</i>, the other a book about igneous rock sediments. Despite the dryness of the subjects, Sunuteel loved the rhythm of English. It was a liquid sounding language, due to the way the words ran together.</p><p>&#x201c;Memory Extracts,&#x201d; the voice announced in English. But then it began speaking another list and each item on it was in a different language, none of which he understood. Annoyed, Sunuteel listened for a while and was about to go back to the main menu when the male voice clearly said, &#x201c;Extract number 5, <i>The Book of Phoenix</i>&#x201d; in English.</p><p>He clicked on it.</p><p>At first there was a long pause and the bird icon popped on the screen. It rotated counter-clockwise. He counted thirteen rotations and when it kept going, he looked up at the sky. Blue. Clear. A large hawk-like bird flew overhead, soaring high in the sky, probably seeing him perfectly with its sharp eyes. <i>I will return to Hussaina in two days</i>, he thought. <i>That&#x2019;s enough alone time for her to stop thinking about premonitions and angels</i>. He smiled to himself. She would excitedly cook him a spicy meal of doro wat when he told her he had &#x201c;a big big tale to tell.&#x201d; She loved a good story, and good stories were best told on a full stomach.</p><p>&#x201c;Memory Extract Number 5,&#x201d; the male voice suddenly announced, making Sunuteel jump. &#x201c;Title: <i>The Book of Phoenix</i>. Location Number 578.&#x201d;</p><p>And then a woman began feverishly speaking. Her soft breathy voice was like a powerful incantation, for as she spoke, it seemed that the old man&#x2019;s eyesight, which dimmed more and more every year, began to brighten. His wife would have recognized what was happening. However, Sunuteel was a man less open to such things.</p><p>Still, as he sat in his tent, gazing through the red virtual words before him and the open tent flap just beyond the words, outside into the desert, he realized he could see for miles and miles. Sweat prickled on his forehead and between the coarse hairs of his armpits. He listened. And the very first person to hear one of the many many entries from <i>The Great Book</i> was awed by the story he heard.</p><p><i>&#x201c;There is no book about me,&#x201d;</i> the voice said.<i> &#x201c;Well, not yet. No matter. I shall create it myself; it&#x2019;s better that way. To tell my tale, I will use the old African tools of story: Spoken words. They are worthier of my trust and they&#x2019;ll last longer. And during shadowy times, spoken words carry farther than words typed, imaged, or written. My beginnings were in the dark. We all dwelled in the dark, mad scientist and speciMen, alike. A dear friend of mine would say that this time was when &#x2018;the goddess Ani still slept&#x2019;. I call my story </i>The Book of Phoenix<i>. It is reliable and short, because it was accelerated&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br></i></p><p><b>CHAPTER 1<br>SpeciMen</b></p><p>I&#x2019;d never known any other place. The 28th floor of Tower 7 was my home. Yesterday, I realized it was a prison, too. I probably should have suspected something. The two-hundred-year-old marble skyscraper had many dark sides to its existence and I knew most of them. There were 39 floors, and on almost every one was an abomination. I was an abomination. I&#x2019;d read many books and this was clear to me. However, this building was still my home.</p><p><i>Home</i>: a. One&#x2019;s place of residence. Yes, it was my home.</p><p>They gave me all the 3D movies I could watch, but it was the plethora of books that did it for me. A year ago, they gave me an e-reader packed with 700,000 books of all kinds. No matter the topic, I consumed those books voraciously, working my way through over half of them. When it came to information, I was given access to anything I requested. That was part of their research. I didn&#x2019;t know it then, but I know it now.</p><p>Research. This was what all The Towers were about. There were seven, all in American cities, yet they were not part of the American government. Not technically. If you dug for information, you would not find one governmental connection on file.</p><p>I had access to information about all the towers, and I read extensively. However, Tower 7 was where I lived, so I studied this tower the most. They gave me many &#x201c;top-secret&#x201d; files on Tower 7. As I said, I was always given what I asked for; this was part of the research. But also, they did not see me as a threat, not to them. I was a perfectly contained classified &#x201c;speciMen.&#x201d; And for a speciMen, knowledge wasn&#x2019;t power.</p><p>Tower 7 was located in Times Square on the island of Manhattan, United States of America. Much of Manhattan was underwater, but geologists were sure this part of it was stable enough for Tower 7. It was in the perfect position for top surveillance and security. I&#x2019;d read about each floor and some of the types of abominations found on them. I&#x2019;d listened to audios of the spiritual tellings of long-dead African and Native American shamans, sorcerers and wizards. I&#x2019;d read the Tanakh, the Bible, and the Koran. I studied the Buddha and meditated until I saw Krishna. And I read countless books on the sciences of the world. Carrying all this in my head, I understood abomination. I understood the purpose of Tower 7. Until yesterday.</p><p>Each tower had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. specializations. In Tower 7, it was advanced and aggressive genetic manipulation and cloning. In Tower 7, people and creatures were invented, altered, or both. Some were deformed, some were mentally ill, some were just plain dangerous, and none were flawless. Yes, some of us were dangerous. I was dangerous.</p><p>Then there was the tower&#x2019;s lobby on the ground floor that projected a completely different picture. I&#x2019;d never been down there but my books described it as an earthly wonderland, full of creeping vines covering the walls and small trees growing from artistically crafted holes in the floor. In the center was the main attraction. Here grew the thing that brought people from all over the world to see the famous Tower 7 Lobby (<i>only</i> the lobby; there were no tours of the rest of the building).</p><p>A hundred years ago, one of the landscapers planted a new tree in the lobby&#x2019;s center. On a lark, some Tower 4 scientists who were there to visit the greenhouse on the ninth floor emptied an experimental solution into the tree&#x2019;s pot of soil. The substance was for enhancing and speeding up arboreal growth. The tree grew and grew. In a place where people thought like normal human beings, they would have uprooted the amazing tree and placed it outdoors.</p><p>However, this was Tower 7 where boundaries were both contained and pushed. The tree g...</p></p><h2>Shanghai Refuge: A Memoir of the World War II Jewish Ghetto</h2><p>The unlikely refuge of Shanghai, the only city in the world that did not require a visa, was buffeted by the struggle between European imperialism, Japanese aggression, and Chinese nationalism. Ernest G. Heppner's compelling testimony is a brilliant account of this little-known haven.&nbsp;Although Heppner was a member of a privileged middle-class Jewish family, he suffered from the constant anti-Semitic undercurrent in his surroundings. The devastation of "Crystal Night" in November 1938, however, introduced a new level of Nazi horror and ended his comfortable world overnight. Heppner and his mother used the family's resources to escape to Shanghai.&nbsp;Heppner was taken aback by experiences on the ocean liner that transported the refugees to Shanghai: he was embarrassed and confounded when Egyptian Jews offered worn clothing to the Jewish passengers, he resented the edicts against Jewish passengers disembarking in any ports on the way, and he was unprepared for the poverty and cultural dislocation of the great city of Shanghai. Nevertheless, Heppner was self-reliant, energetic, and clever, and his story of finding niches for his skills that enabled him to survive in a precarious fashion is a tribute to human endurance.&nbsp;In 1945, after the liberation of China, Heppner found a responsible position with the American forces there. He and his wife, whom he had met and married in the ghetto, arrived in the United States in 1947 with only eleven dollars but boundless hope and energy.&nbsp;Heppner's account of the Shanghai ghetto is as vivid to him now as it was then. His admiration for his new country and his later success in business do not, however, obscure for him the shameful failure of the Allies to furnish a refuge for Jews before, during, and after the war.</p><p>The 18,000 Jews who fled to Shanghai were confined by Japanese forces to an area one mile square. Heppner describes the daily struggle to survive: overcrowding and disease, the underground world of criminals, hunger, heat, and humidity. Nevertheless, Heppner was self-reliant, energetic, and clever, and this first documented nonfiction account by a survivor is a tribute to human endurance.<p>Ernest G. Heppner (1921&#x2013;2004) was an independent management consultant living in Indianapolis. He wrote a new afterword for this Bison Books Edition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Myths of the Sacred Tree</h2><p>Essential to life on earth since the beginning of time, trees hold a special place in our collective consciousness: rooted in the earth, reaching skyward, nourished by the elements, and enlivened by the sap running through their veins, they provide a metaphor for what it means to be human.<br><br>Moyra Caldecott has gathered here a collection of myths celebrating the rich symbolism of trees, all bringing to life a time when the natural world was deeply respected and trees and forests were thought to be inhabited by spirits and divine beings.<br><br>Bound by the organized structure of modern life, the human spirit yearns for the wildness and freedom of primal nature represented by forests in their natural state.

Born in Hillsboro, West Virginia, Buck was the daughter of missionaries and spent much of the first half of her life in China, where many of her books are set. In 1934, civil unrest in China forced Buck back to the United States. Throughout her life she worked in support of civil and women&#x2019;s rights, and established Welcome House, the first international, interracial adoption agency. In addition to her highly acclaimed novels, Buck wrote two memoirs and biographies of both of her parents. For her body of work, Buck received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1938, the first American woman to have done so.

Crumb</h2><p><p><strong>Rumored for years, <em>Drawn Together</em> finally charts the daily exploits and erotic craziness of this &#x201c;First Couple&#x201d; of comics.</strong></p> Who could have imagined that in 1972, when Aline Kominsky, a Long Island escapee and bodaciously talented artist, broke her foot one rainy fall day, it would result in the most unique collaboration in comics history? Laid up in her house, she was persuaded by R. Crumb, her nerdy, neurotic boyfriend, to pass the time drawing together a &#x201c;two-man&#x201d; comic. The result is a jaw-dropping yet tender account, not only of the joys and challenges of a legendary marriage but also of the obstacles faced by struggling female artists. In <em>Drawn Together</em>, our foremost male-female cartooning couple recall their success at shocking America with <em>Weirdo Magazine</em>, the life-altering birth of their precocious daughter Sophie, and their astonishing move to the safe haven of France. With an irresistible introduction and a striking four-color section, <em>Drawn Together</em> becomes a graphic cause-c�lebre and a must-have for any comics devotee.</p><p><p>Born in Philadelphia, <strong>R. Crumb</strong> is the author of numerous comic works and one of the pioneers of underground comics and arguably one of the most famous cartoonists in history.

If his drawing is wonderfully detailed, volumetric, and fluid&#x2015;the justly most famous and admired comics style of our time&#x2015;hers is flat, messy, childishly exuberant, an avatar of the <em>art brut</em> manners of such of her peers as Linda Barry, Roz Chast, and Nicole Hollander.

From primitive vigilance and sonic mythologies to digital sampling and sound installations, he examines the ways in which we make sound speak to us, in an analysis of listening as a plurivocal phenomenon drawing on Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, Barthes, Nancy, Adorno, and de Certeau, and experimental pioneers such as Tesla, Bell, and Raudive. Stringent critiques of the &#x201c;soundscape&#x201d; and &#x201c;reduced listening&#x201d; demonstrate that univocal ontologies of sound are always partial and politicized; for listening is always a selective fetishism, a hallucination of sound filtered by desire and convention, territorialized by discourse and its authorities.</p><p>Bonnet proposes neither a disciplined listening that targets sound &#x201c;itself,&#x201d; nor an &#x201c;ocean of sound&#x201d; in which we might lose ourselves, but instead maps out a sonorous archipelago&#x2015;a heterogeneous set of shifting sonic territories shaped and aggregated by the vicissitudes of desire and discourse.</p></p><p>Fran�ois J.

Frank "Boss" Knight pulled the Hummer up in front of the sad little pre-fab building and glanced at the hand-painted wooden sign screwed over the front door: Becky's Badass Bike Builds.</p> <p>"Too much alliteration for you?" Bill Reichert snickered from the passenger seat while unbuckling his seat belt and throwing open the door. The frigid winter wind whipped into the interior of the vehicle, prompting Frank to grab his black stocking cap from the dashboard and tug it over his head and ears before zipping his parka up to his chin.</p> <p>If this thing actually worked out, Chicago winters were definitely going to take some getting used to. Of course, freezing temps were a small price to pay for a good, solid cover for his new defense firm. And joining Bill's kid sister in her custom Harley chopper business, posing as mechanics and motorcycle buffs, promised to be a freakin' phenomenal cover for all the guys he'd recruited away from the various branches of the armed services. Especially considering most of them were bulky, tattooed, and-without regulation military haircuts-just scruffy enough to pass for their own chapter of Hell's Angels.</p> <p>He pushed out of the Hummer and had to lower his chin against the gust of wind that punched him in the face like an icy fist. Shoving his hands deep in his coat pockets, he trudged up to the front door through the path someone had shoveled in the thick blanket of snow.</p> <p>Bill applied a gloved thumb to the buzzer, and five seconds later, a familiar noise sounded from the behind the metal door, making the hair on the back of Frank's neck stand up.</p> <p>How do you know you've been in the business too long? When you recognize the sound of a .45 caliber being chambered from three feet away, that's how.</p> <p>"Who is it?" a deep, wary voice inquired from within.</p> <p>"I thought you said she knew we were coming," Frank hissed over Bill's shoulder.</p> <p>"She does." Bill grinned. "But she also knows she can never be too careful in this neighborhood."</p> <p>And that was no lie. The graffiti tagging every vertical surface for six blocks in each direction announced that they were smack dab in the middle of some very serious gang territory. The Vice Lords ruled the roost, and they wanted to make damned sure everyone knew it.</p> <p>Raising his voice above the shrieking wind, Bill yelled, "Open the damned door, you big ape! We're freezing our dicks off out here!"</p> <p>And that was no lie either. Frank couldn't even begin to explain to his family jewels why he hadn't jumped into a pair of thermal underwear this morning and instead opted to go commando.</p> <p>Big mistake. Huge.</p> <p>One he sure as hell wouldn't be making again.</p> <p>The front door swung open with a resounding clang, and they were met by a giant, red-headed man who looked like he should be wearing a face mask and leotard while smashing a folding chair over some guy's back.</p> <p>Frank could almost hear Michael Buffer shouting, Arrrrre you ready to ruuumbllle?</p> <p>"Manus," Bill said, stepping over the threshold and motioning Frank through, "this is Boss. Boss, meet Manus. He and his brothers work security for my sister."</p> <p>Frank waited until Manus tucked the .45 into the waistband of his jeans before cautiously stepping into the small, tiled vestibule. The walls were covered in rusted motorcycle license plates, and as soon as the door closed behind him, the aroma of motor oil and burning metal assaulted his nostrils.</p> <p>"You the guy who wants to partner with Becky? Invest some money and learn to build bikes?" Manus asked while pumping the hand he offered, a smile splitting the big man's ruddy face and making all his freckles meld together.</p> <p>Yeah, that was the story they were tossing around until he could get a look at the set-up...</p> <p>"I haven't decided yet," he answered noncommittally, and Manus's smile only widened.</p> <p>"That's only because you haven't seen Becky's bikes," he boasted. "Once you do, you're gonna want to give her all your savings and have her teach you everything she knows."</p> <p>Frank lifted a shoulder as if to say we'll see and watched as Bill opened the second set of glass doors.</p> <p>His ears were instantly assailed by a wall of sound.</p> <p>The pounding beats of hard-driving rock music competed with the hellacious screech and whine of grinding metal. He resisted the urge to reach up and plug his ears as he followed Bill into the custom motorcycle shop, skirting a few pieces of high-tech machinery.</p> <p>And then he wasn't thinking about his bleeding eardrums at all.</p> <p>Because his eyes zeroed in on the most beautiful, outlandish motorcycle he'd ever seen.</p> <p>It was secured on a bike lift. The paint on the gas tank and fenders was bright, neon blue that sparkled iridescently in the harsh overhead lights. It sported a complex-looking dual exhaust, an outrageous stretch, and intricate, nearly whimsical front forks. It also had so much chrome it almost hurt to look at it.</p> <p>In a word: art.</p> <p>It made the work he'd done restoring his vintage 1952 Harley-Davidson FL look like amateur hour.</p> <p>And just when he thought he couldn't be any more blown away, the sound of grinding metal slowly died down and a young woman emerged from behind the bike with a grinder in one hand and a metal clamp in the other.</p> <p>He nearly swallowed his own tongue.</p> <p>This couldn't be...</p> <p>But obviously it was. Because the instant the woman caught sight of them she squealed, clicked off the music pouring out of the speakers of an old-fashioned boom box, and dropped both tools on the bike lift before jumping into Bill's arms, hugging him tight and kissing his cheek with a resounding smack that sounded particularly loud in the sudden silence of the shop.</p> <p>This was Rebecca "Rebel" Reichert, Wild Bill's little sister.</p> <p>Little being the operative word. If she stood two inches over five feet Frank would eat his biker boots for dinner.</p> <p>He didn't quite know what he'd expected of a woman who ran her own custom chopper shop, but it wasn't long, blond hair pulled back in a tight ponytail, intense brown eyes surrounded by lush, dark lashes, and a pretty, girl-next-door face that just happened to be his own personal weakness when it came to women.</p> <p>Something about that wholesome, all-American thing always managed to bring him to his knees.</p> <p>Well, hell.</p> <p>Bill finally lowered her to the ground, and she came to stand in front of Frank, small, grease-covered hands on slim, jean-clad hips. For some inexplicable reason, he felt the need to stand up straighter.</p> <p>It was probably because she had the same unyielding look in her eye that his hard-ass drill sergeant always had back when he'd been in Basic.</p> <p>"So." She tilted her head until her ponytail hung down over her shoulder in a smooth, golden rope. "You must be the indomitable Frank Knight. Billy has told me so very little about you."</p> <p>And that voice...</p> <p>It was soft and husky. The type that belonged solely in the bedroom.</p> <p>"Everyone calls me Boss," he managed to grumble.</p> <p>"I think I'll stick to Frank," she said with a wink. And for some reason, his eyelid twitched. "After all, there can be only one boss around here, and I'm it. Now, I hear you want to get into the business of building bikes?"</p> <p>"I'm considering it." He couldn't help but notice the way her nose tilted up at the end or the way her small breasts pressed against the soft fabric of the paint-stained, long-sleeved T-shirt she wore.</p> <p>Kee-rist, man, get a grip.</p> <p>"Well, then." She nodded, pushing past him as she made her way toward the front door, "let's go take a look at that bike you brought with you and see if you have any talent at all."</p> <p>For a split second, he let his eyes travel down to the gentle sway of her hips before forcing himself to focus on a point over her head as he followed her back through the various machinery. Bill was right behind him, which helped to keep his eyes away from the prize...so to speak. Because the last thing he wanted was to get caught ogling the guy's kid sister.</p> <p>Talk about a no-no of epic proportions. Especially if he didn't fancy the idea of finding one of Bill's size-eleven biker boots shoved up his ass.</p> <p>Once they reached the first set of glass doors, she pulled a thick pair of pink coveralls off a hook on the wall. Balancing first on one foot then the other, she stepped into the coveralls and zipped them up before snagging a bright purple stocking cap from a second hook and pulling it over her head.</p> <p>She looked ridiculous. And feminine. And so damned cute.</p> <p>He gritted his teeth and reminded himself of three things. One, she was way too young for him. Two, if things worked out, then despite what she thought now, he was going to be her boss. And three, he'd made a promise not to-</p> <p>"How much money are you thinking of investing?" she interrupted his thoughts as she pushed through the double doors and into the vestibule.</p> <p>As much as it takes..."We'll talk more about that later." He held his breath, waiting to see how she'd respond to both his authoritative tone and his answer. It was a test of sorts, to determine if they had any hope of working together.</p> <p>She regarded him for a long second, her brown eyes seeming to peer into his head. Then she shrugged, "Suit yourself."</p> <p>When she opened the outer door, he once again had to dip his chin against the icy wind. The three of them slogged through the snow to the small, enclosed cargo trailer hitched to the back of his Hummer, and he fished in his pocket for the keys with fingers already numb from the cold. Once he opened the trailer's back door, she didn't wait for an invitation to jump inside.</p> <p>He and Bill were left to follow her up and watch as she walked around his restored bike before squatting near the exhaust.</p> <p>"You do all the work yourself?" she asked.</p> <p>The bike he'd been so proud of thirty minutes before seemed shoddy and unimaginative by comparison.</p> <p>"Yes," he admitted, amazed he actually felt nervous. Like maybe she wouldn't want to work with him.</p> <p>"Your welding is complete crap," she said, running a finger along a weld he'd thought was actually pretty damned good. "But it's obvious you're a decent mechanic, and that's really what I need right now, more decent mechanics. Plus," she stood and winked, "it might be nice to have a big, strong dreamboat like you around the place day-in and day-out. Something fun to look at when my muse abandons me."</p> <p>He opened his mouth...but nothing came out. He could only stare and blink like a bewildered owl.</p> <p>Holy hell, was she flirting with him?</p> <p>He was saved from having to make any sort of answer-thank you, sweet Jesus-when Bill grumbled, "Cut it out, Becky. Now's not the time, and Boss is definitely not the guy."</p> <p>"No?" She lifted her brows, turning toward Frank questioningly.</p> <p>And now he was able to find his voice. "No." He shook his head emphatically, trying to swallow his lungs that had somehow crawled up into his throat.</p> <p>"Well," she shrugged, completely unflustered by his overt rejection, "you can't blame a gal for trying." She offered him a hand. "I'm in, partner. That is, once I know exactly how much you're thinking of investing."</p> <p>"Bill will get back to you with the specifics," he hedged, taking her hand only briefly before releasing it, more eager to get the hell out of there than he'd care to admit.</p> <p>Again she did that head-tilt thing. The one that caused the end of her ponytail to slide over her shoulder. She regarded him for a long moment during which time he thought his heart might've jumped right out of his mouth had his lungs not been in the way. Then she shrugged and said, "Fine. Go ahead and do that whole mystery-man thing. I don't really give a rat's ass as long as you're good for the green."</p> <p>And with that, she hopped down from the back of the trailer.</p> <p>He moved to watch her traipse through the snow to the front door of her shop. Only once she disappeared inside did he turn to Bill. "You sure she's trustworthy enough? She seems a bit impulsive to me."</p> <p>Impulsive and arrogant and bold and...way too cute for her own good.</p> <p>Bill smiled, crossing his arms. "Despite all evidence to the contrary, Becky's as steady as they come. We can depend on her to keep our secrets. You have my word."</p> <p>"And what about the hierarchy? How's she going to react once she realizes I'm the one calling the shots?"</p> <p>Bill clapped a heavy hand on his shoulder and chuckled. "I have no doubt you can handle her, Boss."</p> <p>Uh-huh. He wished he shared Bill's certainty. Because there was one thing he could spot from a mile away, and that was trouble.</p> <p>And Rebecca Reichert?</p> <p>Well, she had trouble written all over her...</p></p><h2>The Jaguar&#39;s Children</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Extraordinary ...

They had beaten every western army they had come against. Henry II of Silesia was dead, Boleslav IV, Count of the Poles, was in hiding, and the kingdom of Hungary no longer existed; its king, Bela IV, was fleeing to the Adriatic coast pursued by a Mongol army determined to kill him. As for the country itself, the Mongols began to systematically strip and depopulate it and to strike coins. It belonged to Batu, grandson of Jinghiz Khan, the Emperor of All Men. Meanwhile, Pope Gregory IX and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II prepared to continue their person�al war while Mongol scouts approached Venice. There was no army the Europeans could muster to oppose them. There seemed no reason to suppose that Western Europe would not suffer the fate of central Europe and Russia. In February 1241 the Mongol army had left its base in southern Russia and begun to cross the frozen rivers into central Europe. It consisted of about seventy thousand men, all of them cavalry. Nominally com�manded by Batu, a grandson of Jinghiz Khan, he was guided by his grandfather&#x2019;s famous lieutenant, Subotai, a brilliant campaigner. This general had commanded in the campaigns against the Northern Sung of China and had helped in the destruction of the Kwarizmian Em�pire. He had planned the campaign against Europe for a year and the results would show.</p><p>Text: Latin (translation)<br> Original Language: English</p><h2>Murder in Shadow (The Doyle and Acton Murder Series)</h2><p>It seemed a little strange, that Detective Sergeant Kathleen Doyle wound up being the ranking officer on this particular homicide scene.

One of the most frequently cited memoirs of the war, <i>Mary Chesnut's Diary</i> captures the urgency and nuance of the period in an epic rich with commentary on race, status, and power within a nation divided.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Or has it? Thirty years after the first recorded Christmas, one archbishop was already complaining that his flock was spending the day, not in worship, but in dancing and feasting to excess. By 1616, the playwright Ben Jonson was nostalgically remembering the Christmases of the old days, certain that they had been better then.</p><p> Other elements of Christmas are much newer &#x2013; who would have thought gift-wrap was a novelty of the twentieth century? That the first holiday parade was neither at Macy&#x2019;s, nor even in the USA?</p><p> Some things, however, never change. The first known gag holiday gift book, <i>The Boghouse Miscellany</i>, was advertised in the 1760s &#x2018;for gay Gallants, and good companions&#x2019;, while in 1805, the leaders of the Lewis and Clark expedition exchanged&#x2013;what else?&#x2013;presents of underwear and socks. </p><p> Christmas is all things to all people: a religious festival, a family celebration, a period of eating and drinking.

Joining the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry five days after the D-Day landings, the combat-hardened men he was sent to command did not expect him to last long. However, in the following weeks of ferocious fighting in which more than 90 per cent of his fellow tank commanders became casualties, his ability to emerge unscathed from countless combat engagements earned him the nickname of the 'Inevitable Mr Render'.</p><p>In <i>Tank Action</i> Render tells his remarkable story, spanning every major episode of the last year of the Second World War from the invasion of Normandy to the fall of Germany.

Besides writing and reading, she enjoys seeing movies, playing with her puppies, and wrestling with the puzzles in the paper each morning.<br><br>In all the years I'd existed, I'd never expected to be free.<br><br>I was the daughter of Titans, and as such, I'd always accepted it as fact that they would rule. They were without question the most powerful beings in the universe, after all. They controlled everything and everyone. They were our makers. They were our gods.<br><br>But after ten years of rebellion and war in an effort to protect humanity from our father's twisted games, we were the gods now. Still in our infancy compared to our creators, my siblings and I now ruled over the world and all her inhabitants. And as I stared out across the great expanse that was our domain only minutes after our battle had ended, I felt something I thought would end with the war: I felt fear.<br><br>It was unnatural. What did we, the captors of Titans, the new generation of gods, have to be afraid of? But the more I tried to picture the future, the clearer it became to me. We hadn't inherited just the Titans' thrones. We'd inherited their responsibilities, as well. And whether or not we were ready for it, the world was waiting for us. Humanity was depending on us to get it right.<br><br>Lightning lit up the sky, followed by a symphony of thunder, and I snapped out of my reverie. My youngest brother let out a giant whoop that echoed for miles. "Try to beat that," said Zeus, elbowing my middle brother, Poseidon.<br><br>Poseidon scoffed. "That's nothing. Watch this." And with a wave of his hand, the sea below us roared to life, swirling ominously and creating shapes and shadows that danced across the water. Rushing forward, the waves crashed against the cliff we stood on, shaking the very earth.<br><br>"Not bad," said Zeus. "But I've seen better."<br><br>Before I could blink, Poseidon tackled him to the ground, and the pair of them proceeded to spend the next several minutes trying to pin each other down. If humanity was depending on us to get it right, they were in for several eons of disappointment.<br><br>"Don't look so sour, Hera," said Demeter, my sister. She stood beside me, a smile playing on her lips as she watched our brothers wrestle. How she could find amusement in their lack of maturity baffled me.<br><br>"Humanity's going to crumble in a matter of weeks at this point," I said. "They need guidance. Protection. Order and help in establishing a life without the Titans' tyranny. Our brothers are not fit to rule."<br><br>"We are," said Hestia from the other side of Demeter. Both of my sisters watched them with their heads held high, and they looked every inch the queens the world needed. "As is Hades. Zeus and Poseidon will grow up soon enough, I suspect.<br><br>"Never!" cried Zeus, and his booming laughter echoed across the ocean as he managed to gain the upper hand in their wrestling match.<br><br>"See?" I gave my sisters a pointed look. "We're doomed."<br><br>"I wouldn't go quite that far yet." Our eldest brother, Hades, stepped beside me, his dark hair whipping across his face in the wind. He offered me a small smile, and his eyes glittered with intelligence. Something our other brothers sorely lacked. "You did well, sister. If it hadn't been for you, we would've never succeeded."<br><br>My cheeks grew warm. "You're too kind," I said with false humility. I knew as well as he did that by breaking the bonds of the Titans' loyalty to one another, I'd cinched our victory. But the war was over now, and the six of us were a unit that not even I could break. United we had proven to be stronger than even our father, and if we were to have any chance of success, we had to remain that way.<br><br>"Hardly. I dare say you should be ruling us all," said Hades.<br><br>On the ground, Zeus sat up and shoved Poseidon off him. "Hera, Queen of the Gods?" He chuckled and gave me an enormous wink. "Maybe if she had a king."<br><br>He was lucky I was exhausted and weary after battle, else I would've made sure he never had the chance to wink at me or any other girl again. "Are you saying a woman can't rule?" I said.<br><br>"I'm saying it would never work." Zeus stood again, offering Poseidon a hand. Once they were both on their feet, they shoved each other playfully and made their way over to the rest of us. "Humanity is used to a king, and Rhea never exercised her rights as queen. They need a leader right now, not a mother."<br><br>"I could be a leader," I snapped, and hot anger filled me. Zeus knew never to bring up our mother. The loss of her presence was still too fresh. "I would make a damn good one."<br><br>Zeus shrugged and raked his fingers through his golden hair. "Maybe so, but I was the one who led us all to victory. We can all be kings and queens in our own rights, and there's plenty for us to rule over. But as far as a supreme leader goes&#x2014;"<br><br>"Hera won the war for us," said Hades in that quiet, measured voice of his. How he was able to stay so calm in the face of blatant arrogance baffled me. Zeus might have been responsible for the majority of the brute force against the Titans, but he was no more powerful than the rest of us. And he was the youngest and by far the least ready to handle the responsibilities of leadership.<br><br>"We all won the war," said Demeter. "We will all rule together, as a council. We will all have equal say, and we will all listen to and respect one another. It is the only way we will not fall victim to revolt, as the Titans did." She squeezed my hand. "Is that acceptable to you, Hera?"<br><br>As if I had any real say. But all five of my siblings watched me, waiting for me to yield, and I had little choice. I would not be the one to cut the ties that bound us together.<br><br>"As long as it is an equal rule, I can accept that," I said. At least that way the chances of Zeus and Poseidon wreaking havoc were considerably diminished.<br><br>Zeus grinned boyishly. "Then it's settled. Let's draw lots for the kingdoms."<br><br>"The kingdoms?" I said. "But there are only three."<br><br>"Yes," said Zeus with mock patience, as if I were a child who had to be spoken to slowly in order to grasp anything. "Like I said, humanity would never follow a queen."<br><br>The edges of my vision turned red, and I clenched my jaw so tightly that I could have shattered diamond between my teeth. But Zeus went on as if he didn't notice, and three gray pebbles appeared in his hand. "Poseidon," he said with a grand bow, as if he were doing him a favor, letting him draw first.<br><br>Poseidon narrowed his eyes and touched each of the three stones in turn. "I know which domain you want," he said.<br><br>"And you know which domain I want. So why don't you just tell me which one to pick?"<br><br>Zeus scoffed. "Where would be the fun in that?" But the middle stone began to glow, and Poseidon snatched it up. As he held it in his palm, a great crash of sea against rock echoed around us, and the stone exploded into a rush of water.<br><br>Poseidon grinned. "Perfect."<br><br>"Thought you might like that." Zeus turned to Hades next and offered him the remaining stones. "Brother."<br><br>Hades eyed him for a long moment, and it wasn't difficult to see what was going on underneath his mask of neutrality. Allowing Zeus to have the sky domain and ultimate rule over the living was dangerous at best. Zeus wasn't ready for it, but if this council was truly to be, then perhaps we could all temper him. Then again, forcing Zeus into the Underworld to mingle with the dead would kill the light inside him, the same light that had rallied us even when we thought all was lost. Zeus wasn't meant to remain among the dead. It simply wasn't his place in the world, and we all knew it. But that didn't mean he was ready to rule.<br><br>Without breaking his stare, Hades picked up one of the remaining pebbles and cradled it in his palm. I held my breath, and at last the stone burst into flame, an unexpected light in the dark. The Underworld. Of course Hades would sacrifice himself for our brother's happiness.<br><br>Before anyone could react, I snatched the third pebble from Zeus's hand, closing my fist around it. "I will rule the skies," I said. "When you are ready and have proven yourself worthy of kingship, then you may have this stone back."<br><br>"Hera&#x2014;" started Demeter, but Zeus interrupted her.<br><br>"Is that what you want? Further anarchy and pain for humanity?" He drew himself up to his full height, thunder rumbling around him. In that moment, a flash of our father appeared on his face, and I took a step back. "You condemn us to another war if you insist on not allowing me my rightful place."<br><br>"Why is it your rightful place and not mine? Because of my sex?" I spat, sounding far more courageous than I felt in the face of my brother's crackling power. Though mine easily rivaled his, it was quiet, understated, the sort you didn't know was there until it was too late. I could never display my power in such an intimidating manner.<br><br>"Yes," said Zeus without preamble. "Because you had the misfortune of being made in our mother's image, and our mother chose to defer to our father. Because that is the example the Titans set for not only us, but for the world, and we must maintain some order. You will be a queen if you wish, Hera, but only second to one of us."<br><br>No one challenged him. No one spoke to support me. And as those eternal seconds passed, hatred unlike anything I had ever felt before burned within me. Not even for Cronus had I felt such disgust. "I <em>will</em> prove you wrong someday," I snarled. "And when that day comes, you will be cast out and fed to the wolves. Do not say I did not warn you."<br><br>Turning on my heel, I stormed off toward the center of the island. It would be a beautiful place to live if not for the scar of healing earth that led straight into the Underworld, where Cronus and the other Titans now resided. Perhaps it wasn't such a terrible thing that Hades had given up Olympus, after all. At least he could be trusted not to let Cronus escape from the depths of Tartarus.<br><br>"Hera!" called Zeus. "Don't be that way."<br><br>I ignored him. If he didn't want me there, then I wouldn't be there. But soon enough I heard footsteps behind me, and as they grew closer, I stopped and whirled around. "Can't you take a&#x2014;"<br><br>I stopped. It was Hades, not Zeus, who followed me. In the darkness, he looked far too much like our father for my comfort, but we were all used to it by now. He could change his form, as the rest of us could, but I had no doubt he would keep his natural appearance, determined not to let Cronus dictate who and what he was.<br><br>"I am sorry for Zeus," said Hades quietly. "You do not deserve to be spoken to in such a manner."<br><br>I swallowed and held my head high. I wouldn't let Zeus get to me. He wasn't worth it. "I won't be anyone's second. I'm better than that. We all are."<br><br>He managed a faint smile. "You could never be anyone's second, because that would imply someone was more deserving than you. Never doubt that you are the reason we have won, Hera. You are our true power, and we all know it. It is simply difficult for some of us to acknowledge our own lacking."<br><br>A pause, and I deflated. "He'll ruin us."<br><br>"Maybe," he allowed. "Maybe not. Time will tell."<br><br>"I won't rule at his side."<br><br>"I do not blame you." He touched my shoulder. "You deserve better than how he would treat you."<br><br>Something tingled down my spine, and his hand felt warm and heavy against my skin. "I could go into the Underworld with you," I said. "You will need someone to help you sort through the souls."<br><br>For a split second, his understanding smile changed to one of pity, and I bristled. But before I could react, he said kindly, "Nothing would please me more. As much as I would enjoy your company, however, the Underworld would not suit you. I am fine with the darkness and the quiet, but you, sister, would wither without light. And I cannot do that to you."<br><br>"You don't know that for sure," I said. "It would be worth the isolation if I didn't have to be near Zeus."<br><br>He chuckled softly. "As I said, I do not blame you. But something better will come along, and in the meantime, you will have an equal voice on this council."<br><br>"What if that isn't enough? What if Zeus still finds a way to take over?"<br><br>"Then we will deal with that as it happens," said Hades. "I am on your side."<br><br>At least someone was. "You're sure I can't come with you?"<br><br>He pressed his lips to my forehead. "I would never forgive myself for what that place would do to you. But I will come visit you often, and I promise you will never be alone."<br><br>His words warmed me from the inside out, quelling the last of my frustration. "Why do you have to be so good, Hades? Why can't you be more like Poseidon and Zeus? It'd be easier to insist the lot of you weren't fit to rule."<br><br>He squeezed my shoulder. "Because if I were, we would be warring amongst ourselves, and we all know what would happen then. Go back to Olympus, Hera. Rest. I will see you soon, and in the meantime, try not to let Zeus get to you. He's overwhelmed with victory and relief, and that does strange things to men."<br><br>"He's not a man," I said. "He's a god."<br><br>"Then we can expect this to last much longer than it otherwise would." He embraced me for a brief moment before letting me go. "Do not forget your worth."<br><br>With that, he turned and walked toward the sealed crack in the earth, his footsteps leaving no trace in the dirt. I watched him disappear until darkness consumed him, and once he was gone, I took a shaky breath and returned to the others. I would never follow Zeus, but as long as Hades was there to introduce reason, perhaps this new life wouldn't be so bad, after all.<br><br></p><h2>The Harvest Man (Scotland Yard&#39;s Murder Squad)</h2><p>When London discovered that Jack the Ripper was back, it sent Scotland Yard&#x2019;s Murder Squad into chaos.

Meanwhile, Saucy Jack is playing his own games&#x2014;and when the two killers come together, the men of the Yard may never be the same.</p><p><b>Alex Grecian</b> worked for an ad agency before returning to writing fiction full-time and raising his son. He is the author of the long-running and critically acclaimed graphic novel series Proof<i> </i>and Rasputin, and is the author of five Murder Squad novels, including <i>Lost and Gone Forever</i>. Grecian lives in Topeka, Kansas, with his wife and son.Night<br>&nbsp;<br>Mother and Father were sharing a bed. The Harvest Man hesitated in the open bedroom door, staring down at his bare feet, his face flushing scarlet beneath the plague mask. Mother and Father had always slept in separate rooms. He was certain of it. But perhaps their habits had changed over time. That made perfect sense. If they had remained the same, he felt sure he would have found them long ago.<br><br>Mother stirred in her sleep and the Harvest Man finally moved. He wasn&#x2019;t ready for her to wake up. He uncorked a bottle of ether and placed a folded face cloth over the rim, tipped the bottle up and held it until cold liquid soaked through to his fingers. He set the open bottle on the floor next to the doorjamb, where he knew the liquid would silently turn to gas.<br><br>Everything always changing. Things disappearing without a trace.<br><br>He moved forward in slow motion, keeping his head and shoulders straight up and down, only bending at the knees. He made no sound. Mother stirred again, rolled onto her back, and the Harvest Man moved around the foot of the bed to her side. He preferred to deal with Father first. Father was bigger and stronger and, if he woke early, he always caused trouble. But Father was snoring and Mother was moving, on the verge of waking. Better to tend to her.<br><br>He knelt by the bed and gazed at Mother&#x2019;s sleeping face. The room was dark, but the window was open and the moon shone bright. He could see well enough even through his thick lenses. Mother was pretty. He thought she had always been pretty, but she didn&#x2019;t look like he remembered. It took him a moment to categorize the differences. Fortunately, he had a very good memory for faces. Mother&#x2019;s nose was slightly larger now, and was turned up at the tip. Her eyes were spaced closer together and her lips were thinner. She had lost a little weight, and her forehead was wider, her hair a different color, her neck longer, her cheekbones more prominent. He shook his head and the heavy beak at the front of his mask moved back and forth. Why did they always make so much work for him? They shouldn&#x2019;t change so very much. It always made him cross.<br><br>Mother opened her eyes and they were not the same color as he remembered. He hesitated, confused, but when she opened her mouth he clapped the ether-soaked cloth over it, held it tight to her face. She struggled for a moment, then relaxed and her arm fell limp over the side of the bed. He picked up her hand and placed it on her chest.<br><br>Around on the other side of the bed, Father shifted his position and so the Harvest Man leaned far across Mother&#x2019;s limp body, stretched out his arm, the moist cloth pinched between the ends of his two longest fingers, and shared the ether fumes with Father. When both parents were insensible, he left that room and explored the house. He had been in a hurry earlier and had bolted for the attic without taking his customary tour.<br><br>There were two children, both boys, sleeping in a small bed tucked under the staircase. He pushed the plague mask up to the top of his head so he could see them better, enjoying the feel of fresh air on his cheeks and chin. He rubbed his ear. Sometimes it still itched where the top of it had been pulled away. The mask&#x2019;s goggles rested against the back of his head and the long pointed beak stood straight up like a baby bird straining for food. The Harvest Man stood and watched the children&#x2019;s chests move gently up and down. He gazed without affection at the nearest boy&#x2019;s chapped lips, which were parted, the upper lip deeply grooved and dark pink. The boy&#x2019;s eyelids fluttered. The Harvest Man placed his drying face cloth between the children, trusting that the remaining essence of ether would keep them from waking.<br><br>He climbed up the stairs above the sleeping boys and retrieved his boots and knife and a coiled length of stout rope from the attic. He sat on the top step and pulled the boots on. He tugged the plague mask back down into place and adjusted it so that it wouldn&#x2019;t slip from his face while he worked.<br><br>He decided to ignore the boys. He didn&#x2019;t know them. They might be his brothers, but he couldn&#x2019;t remember their faces and so it would do no good to remove their masks. He would ask Mother and Father about the other children when they woke later. Then they could determine together what was to be done. As a family.<br><br>But first things first. Before they could be a family again, he would have to remove Mother and Fathers&#x2019; masks to reveal their true faces. He smiled, excited, and stood, picked up the curved knife and the rope and trotted down the stairs, no longer concerned about making noise. He couldn&#x2019;t wait to see his parents&#x2019; faces again.<br><br>How happy they would be that he had finally found them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Day One<br>&nbsp;<br>Chapter 1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In the late spring of 1890, Number 184 Regents Park Road was a flurry of activity. Upon receiving news of the arrival of twin grandchildren, Mr and Mrs Leland Carlyle ordered their luggage to be packed for an immediate holiday in London and took up residence across the park from their daughter&#x2019;s home in Primrose Hill. Mrs Carlyle visited Claire Day early each morning and stayed on past tea most evenings. She found the household in a state of disarray (or, as she put it to her son-in-law, a state of near vacancy) and determined that her first order of business was to hire a staff. Fiona Kingsley, the young lady who had stayed at Number 184 to look after Claire during the pregnancy, was sent back to her father&#x2019;s home. Within three days, a new governess had been acquired, along with a cook, a scullery maid and a head of housekeeping by the name of Miss Harris. Mrs Carlyle also arranged for three boys from the local reformatory to help clean the house once a week between seven-thirty and nine in the morning.<br><br>Overnight the household became too large to be sustained on the salary of a policeman and Detective Inspector Walter Day began to feel vaguely anxious. The two babies woke at odd hours and Day, who was a light sleeper, rose with them and tried to stay out of the way as the governess tended to them. He did not remember the governess&#x2019;s name, nor did he know the names of the cook and scullery maid. Nobody had bothered to introduce him to Claire&#x2019;s staff and he felt certain he was going to have to let them all go once his in-laws departed. He made no effort to get to know them.<br><br>Violence had recently been visited upon the Day home in the form of a double murder, and reasonable precautions had been taken against future ugliness of the sort. A retired inspector by the name of McKraken had volunteered to stand guard on the house. He kept to himself, but his presence added to the general quality of congestion at Number 184.<br><br>Some sensation had returned to Day&#x2019;s right leg and he got around with a degree of confidence using a cane. The commissioner of police, Sir Edward Bradford, had assigned Day a number of tasks designed to supplement the efforts of the rest of the Murder Squad and, clearly, to keep him sitting at a desk for the bulk of his shifts. Day had petitioned Sir Edward for a meeting on several occasions, hoping to convince the commissioner to give him more challenging work, but he had been ignored. Everyone at the Yard was bustling about, working to catch a murderer known only as the Harvest Man, and boxing up all nonessential items for transport to the new headquarters that were being built for them&#x2014;had, in fact, been nearly finished&#x2014;on the Victorian embankment. Nobody was sitting still except for Day, change was everywhere. The flow of life, he felt, had plucked him off his feet and deposited him on some deserted beach.<br><br>Feeling useless both at home and at the Yard, Day began to spend much of his time at the Chalk Farm Tavern above the canal. That is where Nevil Hammersmith found him at teatime on the first Tuesday of May. Day was at a table in the back, talking with a trio of young solicitors. He had lost track of the amount of ale they&#x2019;d had and he doubted the other men would make it back to their office in Camden Town. When he saw Hammersmith at the tavern door, he stood and moved stiffly around the table. Hammersmith saw him and made his way across the room, through a maze of mismatched tables and chairs. They greeted each other warmly and Day introduced him to Haun, Moore and Peck, the solicitors. After shaking hands all round, those three men politely gathered their glasses and retired to the counter near the front of the pub, surrendering the table to the inspector and his friend.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m headed to Bridewell right now,&#x201d; Hammersmith said. &#x201c;I assume you&#x2019;ve heard the news?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure I haven&#x2019;t. Nobody tells me anything anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>Hammersmith blinked and pulled out a chair. &#x201c;You look rough,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Do I? And how have you been, Nevil? Breathing well enough?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been careful,&#x201d; Hammersmith said. He had been promoted from constable to sergeant after helping Day catch a child murderer, but then almost immediately dismissed from the Yard. In the course of his duties he had been poisoned on two occasions, bludgeoned, nearly frozen to death, and stabbed in the chest with a pair of scissors. It had all been too much for the commissioner of police to bear. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t move as quickly as I once did.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nor do I,&#x201d; Day said.<br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the leg?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Better than it was. Will you have a pint?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tea for me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good. And then you must tell me your news.&#x201d;<br><br>Day called over the proprietor and ordered a pot of Imperial and brown bread. The man nodded and hurried away. Hammersmith watched him go, then leaned forward across the table. &#x201c;Never mind the news. That can wait. I want to know, are you with me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;With you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m sufficiently mobile,&#x201d; Hammersmith said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to find him.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t have to explain. Day knew who he was talking about and he unconsciously rubbed his leg. The scars there were ugly and they ached, and he had been told he would never walk properly again. The most dangerous man in London had held Day captive in a devil&#x2019;s workshop deep beneath the city, had tortured and taunted him. Day had barely escaped with his life.<br><br>Hammersmith had come even closer to an early death. His chest was a battleground of dried black stitchwork. Both men knew that Jack the Ripper was still at large, still roamed the streets, and had not finished his deadly work.<br><br>&#x201c;Come with me now,&#x201d; Hammersmith said. &#x201c;Together we can catch him.&#x201d;<br><br>He leaned back as the tavern&#x2019;s proprietor reappeared with a wooden tray. The jittery little man set a teapot in the center of the table and ringed it with two cups and saucers, a plate of brown and white bread, lemons, a jug of milk, and tiny pots filled with sugar, jam, and thick white butter.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Day said. &#x201c;And a shot of whiskey?&#x201d;<br><br>The man nodded and took the now empty tray back to his counter, out of earshot. Day and Hammersmith busied themselves with the tea for a moment. Day poured in a spot of milk and swirled the dark tea in after it. He spooned in sugar and stirred slowly back and forth, watching the murky liquid fold over on itself, ripple outward and lap gently against the side of the cup. He set the spoon down and sipped, his eyes averted from Hammersmith&#x2019;s face. When he lowered the cup at last, he wiped his lips and sighed.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my leg,&#x201d; Day said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be useless to you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hardly useless. You&#x2019;re the brains of our little outfit, you know. We can catch him, you and I. You figure his game and I&#x2019;ll ferret him out.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sir Edward&#x2019;s been giving me busy work.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yet here you are.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know I&#x2019;ll do it without you. But I&#x2019;d rather have you with me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have two babies, Nevil.&#x201d;<br><br>Hammersmith said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;And if I do go with you? If he catches me again...&#x201d; Day shivered, remembering long hours underground, a scalpel, a laughing madman. &#x201c;If he kills me this time, Claire and the babies will have nothing. They&#x2019;ll be put out in the street.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you really believe that?&#x201d;<br><br>Day filled his cup again and sipped. Claire&#x2019;s parents would jump at the chance to have her back home with them. Her father no doubt already had a proper match in mind for her. She&#x2019;d be remarried within a year and the twins would be raised by some other man. They would take that stranger&#x2019;s name and call him &#x201c;father.&#x201d; Day set his cup down and opened his mouth to respond, but there were no words. The pub&#x2019;s proprietor arrived just in time with the whiskey. Day took the shot, swallowed it and handed back the empty glass.<br><br>&#x201c;Another, would you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right away.&#x201d; The proprietor walked back across the room, wiping the glass with a dirty cloth.<br><br>Day looked again at Hammersmith who held up a hand and nodded. &#x201c;I apologize,&#x201d; Hammersmith said. &#x201c;You have a family. Of course you have a family. And so many other considerations I do not. My God, the Ripper even knows where you live. You must be constantly on edge. It&#x2019;s only... I&#x2019;m frustrated.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know you are. I am too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, you&#x2019;re the only one who knows my frustration. That&#x2019;s why...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just fear, Nevil.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really not. They&#x2019;re hunting this other monster now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The Harvest Man.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. He killed another family last week. The things he did...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll catch him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And I want to help you. But our fellow, Jack, he&#x2019;s all but disappeared.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t that frighten you? What&#x2019;s he up to, do you think?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s killing them. Somehow. He must be. Or planning to at any rate.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack the Ripper was embroiled in a personal war with a secret society of vigilantes who called themselves Karstphanomen. The notion that the Karstphanomen might have won, that Jack might be dead or captured, did not cross Day or Hammersmith&#x2019;s minds. Jack was far too dangerous to go quietly.<br><br>&#x201c;He hates them,&#x201d; Day said. &#x201c;And I honestly can&#x2019;t muster much sympathy for them. It&#x2019;s the Karstphanomen&#x2019;s fault he&#x2019;s at large right now. Their own damn fault he&#x2019;s killing them off.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll make a mistake and I&#x2019;ll be on him before he can hide again.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know you will. At least, you&#x2019;ll catch him if he really does make a mistake, but I don&#x2019;t share your faith that he will.&#x201d;<br><br>Hammersmith opened his mouth to respond, but Day held a hand up, quieting him, as the proprietor appeared once again with a shot glass on his tray. Day took the drink and closed his eyes, held the whiskey in his mouth as it warmed, then finally swallowed it. He opened his eyes again and took a deep breath.<br><br>&#x201c;I must do my job. And only my job. Sir Edward won&#x2019;t acknowledge that Jack&#x2019;s even still alive. I can&#x2019;t make him see the truth and I can&#x2019;t risk my job.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;m on my own.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Get one of the others. Constable Bentley might help.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a policeman anymore, remember? Nobody&#x2019;s going to help me. Not officially.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then give it up. For your own sake. It&#x2019;s too much for you. He&#x2019;ll leave you alone if you let him be, but if you don&#x2019;t he&#x2019;ll get to you before you can find him. I know him. He&#x2019;s almost...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Never mind.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, what were you going to say?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he is a man. I think he&#x2019;s something else.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A woman? He&#x2019;s not a woman. I heard his voice.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Day sighed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what I meant. Forget I said anything. Just let it be. For God&#x2019;s sake, Nevil, you had your chest split o...</p><h2>James Henry Hammond and the Old South: A Design for Mastery (Southern Biography Series)</h2><p><p>From his birth in 1807 to his death in 1864 as Sherman's troops marched in triumph toward South Carolina, James Henry Hammond witnessed the rise and fall of the cotton kingdom of the Old South. Planter, politician, and partisan of slavery, Hammond built a career for himself that in its breadth and ambition provides a composite portrait of the civilization in which he flourished.<br>A long-awaited biography, Drew Gilpin Faust's James Henry Hammond and the Old South reveals the South Carolina planter who was at once characteristic of his age and unique among men of his time. Of humble origins, Hammond set out to conquer his society, to make himself a leader and a spokesman for the Old South. Through marriage he acquired a large plantation and many slaves, and then through shrewd management and progressive farming techniques he soon became one of the wealthiest men in South Carolina. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives and served as governor of his state. A scandal over his personal life forced him to retreat for many years to his plantation, but eventually he returned to public view, winning a seat in the United States Senate that he resigned when South Carolina seceded from the Union.<br>James Henry Hammond's ambition was unquenchable. It consumed his life, directed almost his every move, and ultimately, in its titanic calculation and rigidity, destroyed the man confined within it. Like Faulkner's Thomas Sutpen, Faust suggests, Hammond had a "design," a compulsion to direct every moment of his life toward self-aggrandizement and legitimation. Hammond envisioned himself as the benevolent, paternal, but absolute master of his family and his slaves. But in reality, neither his family, his slaves, nor even his own behavior was completely under his command. Hammond ardently wished to perfect and preserve the southern way of life. But these goals were also beyond his control. At the time of his death it had become clear to him that his world, the world of the Old South, had ended.</p></p><p><p>Drew Gilpin Faust is associate professor and chairman of the Department of American Civilization, University of Pennsylvania.

In what became known as the 'long hard slog', naval aviators sought to slow and cut off communist forces and support troops on the ground. USS <i>Leyte</i> (CV-32) operated off Korea in the Sea of Japan for a record 93 continuous days to support the Marines in their epic retreat out of North Korea, and was crucial in the battles of the spring and summer of 1951 in which the UN forces again battled to the 38th Parallel. </p><p>All of this was accomplished with a force that was in the midst of change, as jet aircraft altered the entire nature of naval aviation. <i>Holding the Line</i> chronicles the carrier war in Korea from the first day of the war to the last, focusing on front-line combat, while also describing the technical development of aircraft and shipboard operations, and how these all affected the broader strategic situation on the Korean Peninsula.</p></p><p><p><b>Thomas McKelvey Cleaver</b> has been a published writer for the past 40 years.

The book also challenges the perceived limits of the genre - it includes a wide range of films, from canonical Sf, such as <i>Le voyage dans la lune, Star Wars </i>and <i>Blade Runner</i>, to films that stretch and reshape the definition of the genre.

We give serious treatment to the underlying theory of financial analysis and valuation, but our main goal is to be able to arrive at a pragmatic answer to the important question, &#x201c;what is this company really worth?&#x201d; To answer this question, we adopt a different approach from other textbooks. The key differences can be summarized as follows: </p> <p> 1. Our focus is on generating good financial statement forecasts. 2. We provide detailed practical guidance on how to obtain and analyze relevant real-world data. 3. We demystify the mechanics of equity valuation. </p> <p> Our overriding theme is that good forecasts of the future financial statements are the key input to a good valuation. Most other aspects of the valuation process are mechanical and can be programmed into a computer. In fact, this text refers often to eVal, a fancy Excel workbook that provides a template for these many mechanical tasks and is freely available. As with many other textbooks, we discuss topics like business strategy analysis, accounting analysis, financial ratio analysis, and so forth. However, we always do so with a clear view to how these analyses help us to generate better financial statement forecasts. We also provide plenty of advice on where to go to obtain the most relevant raw data. Armed with such a rich source of data, we are able to provide you with plenty of practical examples and limitless opportunities for you to practice doing your own analyses. A final goal of this book is to demystify the valuation process. In the past, we have seen students become lost in a sea of valuation formulas and inconsistent spreadsheet models. For example, students get confused as to whether they should use a DDM, DCF, or RIM valuation formula and whether they need to use the CAPM, APT, or MFM to estimate their WACC (and to how many decimal places). They become obsessed with learning acronyms and formulas but flounder when asked to provide a plausible valuation for an actual company. We demonstrate that these different formulas are easily reconciled and refocus students on developing the best set of financial forecasts to plug into these formulas. This reinforces our main point that the key to good valuations is good forecasts. </p> <p> <b>HOW DOES ALL THIS HELP YOU?</b> The theory of financial analysis and valuation is more compelling when linked to real-world examples. The abstract theory of financial statements, ratios, and valuation formulas can be covered in a few boring lectures. What makes this topic exciting is seeing how an organized approach to studying a real company leaves you so much better informed about the firm&#x2019;s future. Is Apple really worth more than any other public company in the world? The answer is probably yes, once you understand its free cash flow generating ability. Tesla wants to produce and sell hundreds of thousands of cars in the future, but can it generate enough cash from existing sales to fund the production of all these new cars? A careful study of their cash flows shows that they will almost certainly be borrowing lots of money to build all these cars. Financial statements, accounting rules, financial ratios, and valuation models are all pretty dull beasts on their own, but if we can use them to answer questions such as these, we can really bring them to life. By blending the theory of equity analysis with practical application, we feel that students learn both more effectively. </p> <p> The book is supported by a comprehensive set of free online resources, including software, cases, and quizzes, all available at http://www.lundholmandsloan.com</p></p><p><b>Russell Lundholm</b> is the Alumni Professor of Accounting at the University of British Columbia Sauder School of Business.

Huber suggests, have in fact been instrumental in shaping the broader cultural politics of American capitalism.</p><p>How did gasoline and countless other petroleum products become so central to our notions of the American way of life? Huber traces the answer from the 1930s through the oil shocks of the 1970s to our present predicament, revealing that oil&#x2019;s role in defining popular culture extends far beyond material connections between oil, suburbia, and automobility. He shows how oil powered a cultural politics of entrepreneurial life&#x2014;the very American idea that life itself is a product of individual entrepreneurial capacities. In so doing he uses oil to retell American political history from the triumph of New Deal liberalism to the rise of the New Right, from oil&#x2019;s celebration as the lifeblood of postwar capitalism to increasing anxieties over oil addiction.</p><p><i>Lifeblood</i> rethinks debates surrounding energy and capitalism, neoliberalism and nature, and the importance of suburbanization in the rightward shift in American politics. Today, Huber tells us, as crises attributable to oil intensify, a populist clamoring for cheap energy has less to do with American excess than with the eroding conditions of life under neoliberalism.<br></p></p><p><p>Matthew T. Huber is assistant professor of geography at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University. </p><p></p><p>"<i>Lifeblood </i>offers a radically alternative way of thinking about &#x2018;cheap oil&#x2019; and &#x2018;oil addiction&#x2019; and in so doing peers beneath the liquid surfaces of petroleum to see how the long century of American oil consumption has been central to the rise of American neoliberalism itself.

How do you decide which you&#x2019;ll tackle next? Do you sort out the project according to the nature of the story? I can imagine, for instance, that a plotline suitable for Sergeant Cribb would be entirely different from one you&#x2019;d flesh out for Peter Diamond. Give us some insight, please.</p> <p><b>Peter Lovesey:</b> You&#x2019;re so right about the differences in plotting. The Cribb books all began with a theme based on a Victorian entertainment: marathon walking, prize-fighting, the music hall, the river, the waxworks and so on. In the Diamond and Mallin series, the setting of Bath or Chichester is a given, so I like to work more with character, finding strong challenges for my detective and his team. The plotting has to be stronger, too, to match their personal struggles. In the new one, <i>Stagestruck</i>, Diamond must resolve a deep-seated fear of being inside a theatre before he can tackle the murder mystery in Bath&#x2019;s Theatre Royal. The Cribb series ran its joyful length in books and TV scripts and I can&#x2019;t see myself getting back to it. Diamond and Hen Mallin are of our time and I want that extra complexity.</p> <p><b>Sue:</b> Since I only have the one series, I can't afford to sell the film or television rights. In this country, a producer buys the rights to the character, not the book itself, which gives him the right to do anything he pleases. When Lawrence Block sold the rights to his Bernie Rodenbarr series ... the role of Bernie ... a white, male Jewish burglar...was given to Whoopi Goldberg. So, of course, I worry that the part of Kinsey Millhone would go to Eddie Murphy. Please believe me, even when I get to "Z" I won't sell the rights. I've made my children and grandchildren take a blood oath to that effect. I've sworn if they ever go up against my wishes in that regard, I'll come back from the grave. They know I can do it, too!<br><br> I&#x2019;ve also read one of your stand-alone crime novels, <em>Rough Cider</em>. Do you prefer the one-offs or the series? Again, are some stories better showcased in one form or the other?</p> <p><b>Peter:</b> Yes, occasionally it&#x2019;s like taking a holiday to write a non-series book. My readers seem willing to enjoy the break, too. I wrote one called <em>The Reaper</em>, about an engaging young vicar called Otis Joy who murders the bishop in chapter one, and of all the books it&#x2019;s the one best loved. What does that say about me and my readers? But, as you suggest, some story ideas will work only in a single book. I wonder if you have some one-offs in store for us after &#x2018;Z&#x2019; Is For... and of course after a well-earned break.</p> <p><b>Sue:</b> The one-off might be me. I'll be close to 80 when I get to 'Z' Is for Zero so we'll see how much juice I have left. I don't want to be one of those writers who goes on and on when readers are crying 'Enough already!' I focus on the book I'm writing at the moment. Ideas that don't seem to be part of the series, I make note of, but I don't devote any energy to them. If I felt I absolutely had to take a break and write a stand-alone, I'd do it, but for the moment, I'm happy where I am.<br><br> Like every other reader, I&#x2019;m curious about your work habits. What time of day do you write? Where? How many hours a day? I&#x2019;m also interested in how long it takes you to write a book. Please fill me in.</p> <p><b>Peter:</b> Ever since I made writing my career I&#x2019;ve tried to treat it as the day job, starting in the morning and working through till about six. I&#x2019;ll take shopping breaks and so on, and sometimes time off can be productive. For me, getting words on the screen is a slow process. I average about 300 a day, but as I don&#x2019;t work in drafts, each of those words must count, so I take care over them. When you add it all up, 300 a day should get the book finished in a year. These days it takes a little longer. Where? In my office in the garden. I call it my shed, but my wife Jax points out that it&#x2019;s double-glazed, carpeted and heated, so it&#x2019;s a cut above the average potting shed. I wouldn&#x2019;t like you to see the clutter inside, though. You once allowed me to see inside your immaculate office (readers can glimpse it on your website) and I was stunned, not to say mortified. In that respect, you and the well-organized Kinsey seem at one.</p> <p><b>Sue:</b> We recently moved and I vowed...VOWED...to get completely organized. The immaculate office you saw seldom remained immaculate for long. Drawers and cupboards were a mess. I always thought I'd be much happier in tidy surroundings, inside and out. In preparation for the move, I redid 455 research files in color coordinared folders, segregated according to whether the contents were personal, book related, or writing related (as in lectures, articles, etc.) This office looks much better than my former office and I make a point of straightening up at the end of each work day. And you know what? I am happier. As for my work habits, I'm much like you. I consider this my job so I'm in my office by 8:30 every morning and wrap up at 3:00 or so when I take a four mile walk. I work 7 days a week unless I'm sick, out of town or have house guests. I try to write two pages a day, but often I write more. Just as often I write less. I'm slow but I'm persistent. I'm a tortoise, not a hare. You seem to be the same.<br><br> What are you currently working on and where are you in the process? Planning stage, book underway, halfway home?</p> <p><b>Peter:</b> I always need to be involved at some stage in the process and I&#x2019;m happy to report as I write this that I have only about forty pages left to type. In my scale of output, that&#x2019;s about five weeks. And where are you with the latest? I imagine you&#x2019;ve long since decided what the remaining titles will be. I did wonder if you lost any sleep trying to think of a word beginning with X.</p> <p><b>Sue:</b> I finished 'V' January 28 and I'm brain dead so it will take a while to recharge my batteries. I haven't lost any sleep thinking about the title to X because I'm not there yet. I have a book out every two years so I'm safe for a while. My hope is that between now and the time I write X, someone will come up with a brand new crime that starts with X and I can use that as a jumping off point. No clue what W and Y will be. Z, as we know, is for Zero. Today, I literally sat down with a dictionary and made a list of all the W words that appealed to me. Then I fell back exhausted. So taxing, this alphabet business!<br><br> You did a book tour in the States some years ago, in the company of Liza Cody and Michael Lewin. The library event I attended was lively and amusing. Any plans to do another road trip? </p> <p><b>Peter:</b> I believe we were among the first mystery writers &#x2013; together with Paula Gosling &#x2013; to get a roadshow touring Britain and the US. We continued to tour in various combinations of twos and threes for several years and we remain on speaking terms. As well as readings, we did skits, radio scripts with sound effects and even juggling. My juggling with five objects behind my back has to be seen to be believed. Far easier than devising a good plot. But we now do our own thing and I&#x2019;ll tour the US bookstores again this summer. Thanks, Sue, for your encouragement and for being an inspiration to so many of us.</p> <p><b>Sue:</b> I thought there was a fourth Brit in that road show, but I'd forgotten about Paula. Was she with you when you came to Kentucky? I'm usually out there by myself doing the old dog and pony show. Hard work any way you slice it. Next time I see you, I want a juggling demonstration! I'm quite sure it's easier than coming up with a workable narrative. You don't need encouragement, kiddo.

Originally published in 1932, on the date of the hundredth anniversary of the arrival in Oklahoma of the first Indians as a result of the United States government&#x2019;s relocation of the Five Civilized Tribes, Indian Removal remains today the definitive book in its field.</p><p>The forcible uprooting and expulsion of the 60,000 Indians comprising the Five Civilized Tribes, including the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, Cherokee, and Seminole, unfolded a story without parallel in the history of the United States. For more than a decade thousands of tragedies and experiences of absorbing interest marked the removal over the "Trail of Tears," but there were no chroniclers at hand to record them. Only occasionally did the tragedy and pathos of some phase of this history-making undertaking beguile a sympathetic officer to turn from routine and write a line or a paragraph of comment.</p><p>From fragments in thousands of manuscripts and in official and unofficial reports Grant Foreman gleaned the materials for this book to provide readers with an unbiased day-by-day recital of events.</p><p></p></p><p><p><strong>Grant Foreman</strong> (1869-1953), known as the dean of American Indian historians, was the author of <em>Indian Removal, The Five Civilized Tribes</em>, and <em>Sequoyah</em> and editor of Ethan Allen Hitchcock?s <em>Traveler in Indian Territo</em>ry, all published by the University of Oklahoma Press.</p><br><br><p><strong>Angie Debo</strong> was reared in a pioneer community, at Marshall, Oklahoma, where it has been her privilege to know from childhood the folkways of the Indians and the traditions of the western settlers.

Population: You Know Everyone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My great-grandfather Burn Hartley opened the parlor in 1885, when Watch Hill was little more than a craggy hamlet where whaling captains came to shake off their sea legs and hold their children for the first time before taking off again for the Atlantic&#x2019;s Great Unknowns. Burn&#x2019;s framed pencil portrait hangs over the entrance, revealing him to have the mad glare of some dead genius writer, or a world explorer who never came home from the Arctic. The truth is, though, he could barely read, preferred familiar faces to strange ones and dry land to the sea. All he ever did was run our little dockside restaurant his whole life, and perfect the recipe for the best clam chowder in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All summer I scooped ice cream for tan teenagers in flip-flops and pastel sweaters. They came and went in big skittish groups like schools of fish. I made cheeseburgers and tuna melts, coleslaw and milk shakes. I swept away sand dusting the black-and-white-checkered floor. I threw out napkins, ketchup packets, salt packets, over-21 wristbands, Del&#x2019;s Frozen Lemonade cups, deep-sea fishing party boat brochures. I put lost cell phones beside the register so they could be easily found when the panic-stricken owners came barging inside: &#x201c;I lost my . . . Oh . . . thank you, you&#x2019;re the best!&#x201d; I cleaned up the torn blue tickets from the 1893 saltwater carousel, located just a few doors down by the beach, which featured faded faceless mermaids to ride, not horses.

I dusted the brine off the mussels and the clams, polishing every one like a gemstone dealer obsessively inspecting emeralds. Most days I rose at five and went with my dad to pick out the day&#x2019;s seafood when the fishing boats came in, inspecting crab legs and fluke, oysters and bass, running my hands over their tapping legs and claws, barnacles and iridescent bellies. I composed song lyrics for a soundtrack to a made-up movie called Lola Anderson&#x2019;s Highway Robbery, drawing words, rhymes, faces, and hands on napkins and take-out menus, tossing them in the trash before anyone saw them. I attended grief support group for adolescents at the North Stonington Community Center. There was only one other kid in attendance, a silent boy named Turks whose dad had died from ALS.

What goes on in our minds when we become absorbed in a movie? How does looking &#x201c;into&#x201d; a movie screen allow us to experience the thoughts and feelings of a movie&#x2019;s characters? These and related questions are at the heart of <i>The Power of Movies, </i>a thoughtful, invigorating, and remarkably accessible book about a phenomenon seemingly beyond reach of our understanding. Colin McGinn&#x2013;&#x201c;an ingenious philosopher who thinks like a laser and writes like a dream,&#x201d; according to Steven Pinker&#x2013;enhances our understanding of both movies and ourselves in this book of rare and refreshing insight.</p><p><b>Colin McGinn</b> is a professor of philosophy at Rutgers University. He is the author of sixteen previous books, including <i>The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey Through Twentieth-Century Philosophy; Space Trap,</i> a novel; and, most recently, <i>Mindsight: Image, Dream, Meaning. </i>McGinn&#x2019;s writing has appeared in such publications as <i>The New York Review of Books, London Review of Books, The New Republic,</i> and <i>The New York Times Book Review.</i>One<br><br> THE POWER OF FILM<br><br> The Mind-Movie Problem<br><br> The power of film is indisputable. Since the beginning of movies, a little over a hundred years ago, they have captivated audiences. We want, badly, to watch. And this power seems unique to film. As the philosopher Stanley Cavell remarks, in The World Viewed, &#x201c;the sheer power of film is unlike the powers of the other arts.&#x201d;1 There is something about movies specifically&#x2014;whether they emanate from America or France, Britain or Sweden&#x2014;which succeeds in connecting to the human psyche in a deep way. Movies carry some sort of psychic charge that no other art form&#x2014;perhaps no other spectacle&#x2014;can quite match.<br><br> Their power is manifested in two ways: demographically and individually. Movies simply have a larger mass appeal than any other artistic medium. Nothing draws crowds in the millions like a new movie&#x2014;and this was so from the very beginning. (It is this fact that explains the colossal investment of money that goes into the movie business. What would the movie industry be like today if movies had the demographics of, say, opera or stamp collecting?) People read novels and go to the theatre, of course, but it is the cinema that really packs them in. And this mass appeal is remarkably cross-cultural. All across the world people flock to the movies, and it is amazing how easy it is for a movie from one country to cross boundaries into another, perhaps with suitable subtitles or dubbing&#x2014;I once watched a Clint Eastwood cowboy film in Paris in which the tough gunslinger intoned the words &#x201c;Fermez la porte&#x201d; in an impeccable French accent.<br><br> There is also, at the individual level, the quality of the attraction&#x2014;the sheer intensity of the movie-watching experience. From childhood on, we are all familiar with that sense of entrancement that accompanies sitting quietly in the pierced darkness of the movie theatre. The mind seems to step into another sphere of engagement as the images on the screen flood into our receptive consciousness. We are gripped. The quality of this mental engagement, the way the mind is invaded and commandeered, is something that has been evident since the early days of the silent era, when film was at its least technologically sophisticated. The moving image itself seems an object of extraordinary potency. In the movie-watching experience we enter an &#x201c;altered state of consciousness,&#x201d; enthralling and irresistible.<br><br> What is it about movies that explains their amazing hold over the human mind? Why do we love movies (and we do love them&#x2014;thrill to their presence, romanticize them, suffer when they let us down)? Clearly, there must be something about those light projections through celluloid, on the one hand, and the nature of the human mind, on the other, that accounts for the seemingly preordained match that exists between them. How do they manage to mesh so naturally, smoothly, and overwhelmingly? I like to call this the &#x201c;mind-movie problem,&#x201d; by analogy with the philosophical mind-body problem.2 The mind-body problem is the problem of explaining how conscious experience relates to the physical materials of the body and brain; the mind-movie problem is the problem of explaining how it is that the two-dimensional moving image, as we experience it in a typical feature film, manages to hook our consciousness in the way it does. How do these jumpy splashes of light contrive to strike our mind with such force? Somehow movies and the mind are suited to one another, mutually adapted&#x2014;and I want to explain what it is about both terms of this nexus that makes it as charged as it is. What is it about the screen image and the mind that views it that makes the marriage between them so successful&#x2014;so passionate and tempestuous, one might almost say? What is this love affair with the screen?<br><br> Dubious Suggestions<br><br> What accounts for the power of film? An obvious first thought is that movies are uniquely realistic&#x2014;they recreate or reproduce the very events that they record. The camera, in this view, is a device for making available, for later consumption, the very same worldly events that took place before it at some earlier time. Accordingly, what we see in the movies is indistinguishable from what we would have seen had we been there at the original shooting. Suppose you would like to see what some historical battle actually looked like to a living onlooker; well, movies enable you to have this experience without having to travel back in time and witness the events themselves or have before you armies of real actors. Movies literally recreate worldly events before our very eyes. They duplicate reality. Seeing film is just like seeing the reality filmed. And reality certainly has the power to hold our attention.<br><br> This view is inadequate for a couple of reasons. It is simply not true that the movie image literally reproduces real events. We are never fooled by a movie depiction of a battle into thinking that we are really there&#x2014;or else we might head smartly for the exit. A movie is not some kind of illusion of reality, if that means something that appears just like reality itself but isn&#x2019;t. We never really mistake a movie image for a real object, as if thinking that Harrison Ford, say, is in the theatre with us, feet away. The power of movies cannot be identical to the power of seeing the real events; the movie&#x2019;s power must lie in what distinguishes it from seeing real events. The power of seeing a real battle is just a different kind of power from that of seeing a movie of a battle (though that is not to say that the first kind of power is totally irrelevant to the second). Similarly, we can readily distinguish the stage in the performance of a play from the real world, not somehow confusing the events of the play with real events. We can likewise distinguish the screen in a movie theatre from a chunk of real reality (so to speak), not taking the images before us literally to be real objects and situations. The power of cinema does not derive from its giving us the full-blown illusion of reality&#x2014;as when I might actually hallucinate the presence of a monster and be genuinely afraid, having taken the illusion to be reality. It is not that in a horror film, say, I am under the impression that a living (or unliving) vampire is literally standing not ten feet in front of me, and find myself understandably riveted; I know very well that it&#x2019;s just a picture of a vampire. And yet I am still riveted (though in a different way).<br><br> Nor do we find movies fascinating precisely in proportion to how fascinating we find reality. Reality itself might leave us bored and indifferent, but when it comes to us in the form of a movie image it can take on life and meaning. Watching someone light a cigarette in real life can be pretty dull, but in the context of a story projected onto the movie screen our eyes and mind will be drawn in. The movie adds something to reality, and this is part of its power (later we will explore in detail what exactly it adds). It is the same with painting: the interest of a portrait is very different from the interest we take in its sitter, who may be quite uninteresting to look at. The visual arts are not in general attempts to produce twins of real people. It is not the alleged lifelikeness of cinema that determines its interest for us, since (a) it is not lifelike in any literal sense, and (b) being lifelike is not enough to confer fascination on something. In short, the psychological power of a representation of something is not the same as the psychological power of that thing. Art, in other words, is transformative.<br><br> A different suggestion might be that movies engage our mind, not by simulating reality, but by offering us fiction. We love stories in general, and movies tell us stories in visual images instead of words on the page. Does our taste for fictional narratives explain our liking for movie narratives? We are quite aware that it is all just fiction; but fiction is what we crave, not quotidian reality. What moves us at the movie theatre is the power of the imagination.<br><br> Now it is certainly true that the fictional content of films must be part of their appeal&#x2014;we like to get caught up in a good yarn&#x2014;but this suggestion suffers from not specifying what it is about movies in particular that grips us so. What is it about films, as opposed to novels, that gives rise to our special engagement with them? It isn&#x2019;t just the story being told&#x2014;indeed, we might find the story banal if it came to us in merely verbal form&#x2014;it is the form in which the story comes to us that enthralls us. It is the fact that it is a story on film that creates the special power of cinema, not simply being a story told in some medium or other. If it were just the latter, then we might well prefer to stay home and read a book&#x2014;which would be easier and cheaper. But what we crave when we itch to see a film is the particular nature of the cinematic experience&#x2014;which includes, but is not exhausted by, the embedded narrative itself. Clearly, the experience of seeing photographic images on a screen is very different from seeing or hearing words that describe the selfsame events. We need to identify what specific properties of film contribute to the movie-watching experience. Obviously, seeing a film is not the same as hearing someone tell you the story of it!<br><br> It might be maintained that it is the ideological content of cinema that explains its sway over the minds of the audience. The movies, it is said, support and reinforce the prevailing ideology of the society within which they are made and viewed, and the population has already been brainwashed by this ideology into being mesmerized by the cinema&#x2019;s own version of it. The movies thus collude with the prevailing ideology, which has already wormed its way into the deeper layers of the audience&#x2019;s psyche. For example, a romantic comedy might reinforce sexual stereotypes, connecting with the attitudes already present in the audience. The power of cinema is thus the power of ideology.</p><h2>Smoke in the Sun (Flame in the Mist)</h2><p><b><b>The highly anticipated sequel to</b><b><i> New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling</b><b><i> Flame in the Mist</i></b><b>--an addictive, sumptuous finale that will leave readers breathless from the bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Wrath and the Dawn</i></b><b>. </b></b><br><br>After Okami is captured in the Jukai forest, Mariko has no choice--to rescue him, she must return to Inako and face the dangers that have been waiting for her in the Heian Castle.

Betrothed to the son of the emperor&#x2019;s favorite consort. Bestowing honor to the Hattori name.<br><br>The scented water in the wooden <i>furo </i>felt the same as it did at home. Like heated silk sliding across her skin. The hands scrubbing at Mariko&#x2019;s arms and shoulders did so in much the same way they&#x2019;d done at home &#x2014; without mercy, until her pale skin shone like that of a newborn child, pink and raw and perfect. A servant with permanent lines of judgment marrying her brow yanked a comb inlaid with mother-of-pearl through Mariko&#x2019;s hair in much the same way her nursemaid had when she was younger.<br><br>It all felt so similar.<br><br>But if Mariko could be certain of nothing else now, she could be certain her life would never be the same again.<br><br>Under her brother&#x2019;s watchful care, they&#x2019;d arrived in Inako late last night. To an imperial city cloaked in mourning. To streets teeming with whispers. Today was the funeral of their emperor, who had died suddenly, beneath a veil of suspicion. Upon discovering his body, the empress&#x2019;s wailing was said to have been heard across all seven <i>maru</i>. Even beyond the castle&#x2019;s iron-and-gold-plated double gates. She&#x2019;d screamed murder. Raged at all those nearby, accusing them of treachery. It had taken a flock of maidservants to soothe her and begin ushering her toward her tears.<br><br>Toward final whimpers of resignation.<br><br>But beneath this hushed intensity seethed something sinister. Last night &#x2014; when the second pair of gates leading to the castle had creaked closed behind their convoy &#x2014; the air around Mariko had stilled. The faint breeze blowing past the woven screen of her <i>norimono </i>had sighed a final sigh. An owl had blared across the firmament, its cry ringing off the stone walls.<br><br>As though in warning.<br><br>Here in Inako, Mariko would not be granted a moment&#x2019;s respite. Nor did she wish for one. She would not allow herself anything of the sort.<br><br>For deep in the bowels of the same castle, the last in a line of celebrated shogun awaited his impending doom: the final judgment of the imperial city. And the lies this city wore &#x2014; lies cloaked in silk and steel &#x2014; shimmered beneath the surface, ready to take shape. No matter the cost, Mariko would mold them into what they should have been from the start:<br><br>The truth.<br><br>She bit down hard on nothing. Braced herself for the coming fight. It would be unlike any Okami and the Black Clan had taught her in Jukai forest. In this fight, she would not have weapons of wood and metal and smoke at her disposal. She would instead be armed with nothing more than her mind and her own mettle. This would be precisely the kind of fight she&#x2019;d unknowingly prepared for as a child, when she&#x2019;d pitted herself against her brother Kenshin.<br><br>In a game of wits against brawn.<br><br>Here in Inako, Mariko&#x2019;s armor would not be hardened leather and an ornamented helmet. It would be perfume and powdered skin. She had to convince Prince Raiden &#x2014; her betrothed &#x2014; to trust her. She needed him to cast her as the hapless victim instead of the willing villain.<br><br><i>Though I plan to be a villain in all ways.<br></i><br>If it took everything from Hattori Mariko &#x2014; even her very life &#x2014; she would not allow those she loved to fall prey to those set on destroying them. She would learn the truth about who conspired to kill her that day in the forest. Why they attempted to frame the Black Clan for the deed. And what deeper cause lay beneath their designs.<br><br>Even if those at the heart of the matter were the imperial family itself.<br><br>Even if her own family might fall into the crosshairs.<br><br>The thought sent a chill through her bones, as though the water in the&nbsp;<i>furo</i>&nbsp;had suddenly turned to ice.<br><br>Kenshin&#x2019;s choice had been made long before he&#x2019;d marched into Jukai forest flying their family crest alongside that of the emperor. Even before he&#x2019;d let soldiers loose arrows around his only sister in a shower of fire and ash. He was a samurai, and a samurai followed the orders of his sovereign, to the death. He did not ask questions.<br><br>His pledge was one of unswerving conviction.<br><br>But Mariko's time with the Black Clan had taught her the cost of blind faith. She refused to align the Hattori name with that of the shiftless nobles in the imperial city. The same nobles intent on lining their pockets and gaining influence at the expense of the downtrodden. The same people they&#x2019;d sworn to protect, like the elder woman who cared for the children in the Iwakura ward, who depended upon Okami and the Black Clan for support.<br><br><i>Protect.<br></i><br>Mariko drew her knees to her chest, shielding her heart, preventing the worst of her thoughts from taking root.<br><br><i>What if Okami is already dead?<br></i><br>She tightened the grip on her knees.<br><br><i>No. He isn&#x2019;t dead. He can&#x2019;t be. They will want to make a show of his death.<br></i><br><i>And I will be there to protect him when they do.<br></i><br>It was strange to think Mariko possessed the power to protect someone she loved. She&#x2019;d never known the right words to do so before. Never known how to wield the right weapons. But ingenuity could be a weapon, in all its forms. Her mind could be a sword. Her voice could be an axe.<br><br>Her fury could ignite a fire.<br><br><i>Protect.<br></i><br>Mariko would never allow Okami &#x2014; the boy who had stolen her heart in the dead of the night, deep within a forest of rustling trees &#x2014; to lose all he'd fought to regain. Nor would Mariko allow herself to lose anything she loved. She&#x2019;d watched in the shadows as Kenshin had permitted soldiers to descend on her in Jukai forest. Felt the pang of her brother&#x2019;s betrayal with each of his questioning glances. She&#x2019;d bitten her tongue as these same soldiers had forced Okami to kneel in the mud and surrender. As they&#x2019;d taunted and derided him from their lofty perches.<br><br>Mariko swallowed, the bitterness coating her throat.<br><br><i>Never again. I will protect you, no matter the cost.<br></i><br>&#x201c;Look at your nails.&#x201d; The creases across the servant&#x2019;s brow deepened as she spoke, cutting through Mariko&#x2019;s deliberations. Her admonition conjured more memories of Mariko&#x2019;s childhood. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s as though you&#x2019;ve been digging through mud and stone all your life.&#x201d; She&nbsp;<i>tsk</i>ed, inspecting Mariko&#x2019;s fingers even further. &#x201c;Are these the hands of a&nbsp;<i>lady</i>&nbsp;or a scullery maid?&#x201d;<br><br>Her sight blurred as she gazed at her scarred knuckles. Another pair of hands took shape in her mind&#x2019;s eye, its calloused fingers intertwined with hers. Laced together. Stronger for it.<br><br><i>Okami.<br></i><br>Mariko blinked. Organized the chaos of her thoughts into something coherent. She bit her lip and widened her eyes. &#x201c;The Black Clan . . . they made me work for them.&#x201d; Her voice sounded small. Insignificant. Exactly as she intended.<br><br>The servant chuffed in response, her expression still dubious. &#x201c;It will take the work of an enchantress to repair this damage.&#x201d; Her words remained harsh, unmoved by the sight of Mariko&#x2019;s feigned timidity. Strangely &#x2014; though this woman&#x2019;s rebuke was in no way comforting &#x2014; it nevertheless warmed Mariko. It brought to mind her mother&#x2019;s quiet, ever-present judgment.<br><br><i>No. Not just that.<br></i><br>The servant reminded her of Yoshi.<br><br>At the thought of the grumblingly good-natured cook, Mariko&#x2019;s eyes began to water in earnest.<br>The servant watched her, an eyebrow peaking into her forehead.<br><br>That time, the sight of the older woman&#x2019;s judgment spurred a different reaction.<br><br>Anger roiled beneath Mariko&#x2019;s skin. She snatched her hand away and averted her gaze, as though she were afraid. Ashamed. The servant&#x2019;s stern expression lost some of its severity. As though Mariko&#x2019;s embarrassment was an emotion she could understand and accept. When she next took hold of Mariko&#x2019;s hand, her touch was careful. Almost soft.<br><br>In the same instant Mariko fought to curb her anger, she paused to take note.<br><br><i>My fear &#x2014; even when it is feigned &#x2014; has more weight when it is matched alongside anger.<br></i><br>One of the young women assisting the gruff servant bowed beside the wooden tub before lifting a pile of muddied, fraying clothing into the light. &#x201c;My lady, may I dispose of these?&#x201d; Her round face and button nose squinched in disgust.<br><br>They were the garments Mariko had worn in Jukai forest, when she&#x2019;d been disguised as a boy. She&#x2019;d refused to discard the faded grey&nbsp;<i>kosode</i>&nbsp;and trousers, even at Kenshin&#x2019;s behest. They were all she had now. Her eyes widening in what she hoped to be a sorrowful expression, Mariko shook her head. &#x201c;Please have them washed and stored nearby. Though I long more than anything to forget what happened to me, it is important to keep at least one reminder of the consequences when a wrong turn is taken in life.&#x201d;<br><br>The ill-tempered elder servant harrumphed at her words. Another young girl in attendance grasped one of Mariko&#x2019;s hands and began scrubbing beneath her nails with a brush fashioned from horsehair bristles. As she worked, the servant with the round face and button nose poured fine emollients and fresh flower petals across the surface of the steaming water. The colors of the oil shimmered around Mariko like fading rainbows. A petal caught on the inside of her knee. She dipped her leg beneath the water and watched the petal float away.<br><br>The image reminded her of what the old man at the watering hole had said the night she&#x2019;d first met the Black Clan, disguised as a boy. He&#x2019;d told her she had a great deal of water in her personality. Mariko had been quick to disagree with him. Water was far too fluid and changeable. Her mother had always said Mariko was like earth &#x2014; stubborn and straightforward to a fault.<br><br><i>I need to be water now, more than ever.<br></i><br>Mariko wondered what had become of the Black Clan after Okami had surrendered to her betrothed. Wondered how Yoshi and Haruki and Ren and all the others had fared following such a dire blow. Only three nights past, they&#x2019;d learned their leader had been deceiving them for years. He was not in fact the son of Takeda Shingen. The boy they&#x2019;d followed and called &#x201c;Ranmaru&#x201d; for almost a decade was instead the son of Asano Naganori. He&#x2019;d assumed the role of Takeda Ranmaru to protect his best friend and make amends for his father&#x2019;s betrayal &#x2014; a betrayal that had resulted in the destruction of both their families. This boy&#x2019;s real name was Asano Tsuneoki.<br><br>They&#x2019;d all been deceived.<br><br>And Mariko&#x2019;s betrothed &#x2014; Prince Raiden &#x2014; had left the forest with a prize worthy of laying at his father&#x2019;s burial mound.<br><br>The true son of Takeda Shingen, the last shogun of Wa: Okami.<br><br>Resentment smoldered hot and fast in Mariko&#x2019;s chest. Guilt coiled through her stomach. She dared to sit in a pool of scented water, allowing her skin and hair to be brushed and polished to perfection while so many of those she cared about suffered untold fates?<br><br>She took a steadying breath.<br><br>This was necessary. This was the reason she&#x2019;d asked Kenshin to bring her to Inako. If Mariko intended to act on the plans she&#x2019;d formulated while journeying from Jukai forest to the imperial city, she had to be in the seat of power. Mariko had to find a way to free Okami. She had to convince her betrothed that she was the willing, simpering young woman he surely desired in a bride. Then &#x2014; once she&#x2019;d earned a measure of trust &#x2014; she could find a way to begin feeding information to the outside. To those who fought to change the ways of the imperial city and restore justice to its people.<br><br>To topple evil from its vaunted pedestal.<br><br>&#x201c;Stand,&#x201d; the servant demanded in a curt tone.<br><br>Respect for an elder &#x2014; regardless of status &#x2014; drove Mariko to obey the truculent woman without question. She let the woman lead her to the largest piece of polished silver she&#x2019;d ever seen in her life. Her eyes widened, and she stifled the urge to react to the sight of her naked body reflected back at her.<br><br>Her time in Jukai forest had changed Mariko on the outside as well. The angles of her face were more pronounced. She was thinner. What had been willowy before was now honed. Muscles she&#x2019;d not known she&#x2019;d possessed moved as she moved, like ripples across a pond.<br><br>She was stronger now, in more ways than one.<br><br>The elderly servant&nbsp;<i>tsk</i>ed again. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re as thin as a reed. No young man will want to caress skin and bones, least of all one like Prince Raiden.&#x201d;<br><br>Again the urge to react rose in Mariko&#x2019;s throat. Though she could not really discern the reason for the woman's disdain, she suspected the servant believed a girl who lived among bandits did not deserve to marry into the imperial family. Did not merit the attention of a prince. The truth blazed bright within her. She was more than an object of any man&#x2019;s desire. But on this particular score, the servant was right. She did need to eat if she intended to play the part.<br><br><i>Be water.<br></i><br>Mariko smiled through gritted teeth. Let her lips waver as though she were exhausted. Weak. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. Please do whatever you can &#x2014; whatever magic you possess &#x2014; to restore me to my past self. To the sort of young woman who might please the prince. I want nothing more than to forget what happened to me.&#x201d; She struggled to stand taller. Fought to look proud.<br><br>Though the creases on her features deepened, the servant nodded. &#x201c;My name is Shizuko. If you do as I say, it is possible we can remedy the effects of this . . . misfortune.&#x201d;<br><br>Mariko slid her arms into the proffered silken undergarment, wondering why the elder servant displayed such disdain for her. &#x201c;Make me fit for a prince, Shizuko.&#x201d;<br><br>Shizuko sniffed and cleared her throat before directing the other servant girls to come forward. In their arms were more bolts of lustrous fabric. Piles of damask and painted silk, wrapped in sheets of translucent paper. Trays of jade and silver and tortoiseshell hairpieces.<br><br>Mariko ran the tip of a finger down the needled point of a silver hairpiece. Recalled one of the last times she had held one in her hand.<br><br>The night she&#x2019;d pierced it through a man&#x2019;s eye for attacking her.<br><br>Mariko knew what she needed to do. For the sake of those she held dear, she needed to appear tall and proud.<br><br>And hapless.<br><br>She spoke in a near whisper, as though her words were nothing but an afterthought. &#x201c;The imperial family will need me to appear strong, just as they are.&#x201d;<br><i>Just as they will need to be.<br></i><br>Because Hattori Mariko had a plan.<br><br>And this unwitting woman had already provided her with the first piece of the puzzle.</p><h2>Assimilate or Go Home: Notes from a Failed Missionary on Rediscovering Faith</h2><p><p>From childhood, D.L. Mayfield longed to be a missionary, so she was thrilled when the opportunity arose to work with a group of Somali Bantu refugees in her hometown of Portland, OR. As the days, months, and years went by, her hopeful enthusiasm began to wear off, her faith became challenged, and the real work of learning to love and serve her neighbors grew harder, deeper, and more complex. She writes: &#x201c;The more I failed to communicate the love of God to my refugee friends, the more I experienced it for myself. The more overwhelmed I felt as I became involved in the myriads of problems facing my friends who experience poverty in America, the less pressure I felt to attain success or wealth or prestige. And the more my world started to expand at the edges of my periphery, the more it became clear that life was more beautiful and more terrible than I had been told.&#x201d;</p><p>In this collection of stunning and surprising essays, Mayfield invites readers to reconsider their concepts of justice, love, and reimagine being a citizen of this world and the upside-down kingdom of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>D. L. MAYFIELD</strong> has nearly a decade of experience working with refugee communities in the United States.

With her immersive storytelling... she reminds us that often enough, our trivial, messy ministries matter as kingdom work.&#x201d; (<b><i>Christianity Today</i></b>)<br><br>&#x201c;Mayfield&#x2019;s new book arrives at a difficult moment in American conversations about refugees, the future of Christianity, and the role of religion in an increasingly secular society. [The book] challenges many preconceptions about evangelicalism, missionary work, and what it means to live a life of social justice and faith.&#x201d; (<b><i>Religion Dispatches</i></b>)<br><br>&#x201c;I have loved watching D.L. Mayfield find her voice in the wild world of Christendom. On these pages it is clear that we are wounded healers, that the path to God is one of downward mobility, and that all the ground is level at the foot of the cross.&#x201d; (<b>Shane Claiborne, author, activist, and director of Red Letter Christians</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Assimilate or Go Home</i> is inconvenient and necessary, hopeful and unflinching, humble and wry; it is as ferocious as love. During this age of the Church when we too often worship worldly obvious success, we need to receive D.L.

Mayfield&#x2019;s close observation of the journey of refugees trying to make a new life abroad while desperately missing the homes they were forced to abandon is required reading in an age of increased turmoil surrounding the status of refugees worldwide.&#x201d; (<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b>)<br><br>&#x201c;D. L. Mayfield&#x2019;s voice aches like a psalmist&#x2019;s; it sings out like the prophets of old. This book is not the next hot new thing. It is ancient wisdom, distilled from the daily grind, rendered in the vernacular of American life.&#x201d; (<b>Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, author of <i>Strangers at My Door</i></b>)<br><br>&#x201c;What is the good news? That is the central, vital question in Mayfield&#x2019;s deeply felt essays. In a season of such great fear of &#x201c;the other,&#x201d; her observations and exhortations are especially timely. Mayfield&#x2019;s heart is huge, her questions important. And at its best, her lovely prose pierced my soul.&#x201d; (<b>Jeff Chu, author of Does Jesus Really Love Me?</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;In this beautiful, heartbreaking debut, Mayfield pulls back the curtain on her difficult life in the refugee community. A must-read for anyone who dreamt of <i>changing the world for God</i>...and instead discovered that life is much more charged with glory and brokenness than we ever knew.&#x201d; (<b>Addie Zierman, author of <i>When We Were on Fire</i> and <i>Night Driving</i></b>)<br><br>&#x201c;This winsome memoir captures the zeal and the vulnerability of Mayfield&#x2019;s experience living and working among a community of Somali Bantu refugees in Portland, OR.&#x201d; (<b><i>Relevant Magazine</i></b>)<br><br>&#x201c;Mayfield beautifully chronicles her earnest efforts to befriend her refugee neighbors and introduce them to God-only to find that she herself meets God in new, profound ways. <i>Assimilate or Go Home</i> is among the most refreshing books I have read in years: funny, wise, and convicting.&#x201d; (<b>Matthew Soerens, U.S. Director of Church Mobilization at World Relief and co-author of <i>Seeking Refuge: On the Shores of the Global Refugee Crisis</i></b>)</p><h2>Force Of Nature</h2><p>Five women go into the Australian bush on a team-building exercise; only four come back.

So much so that it reminded me of another master of form, Liane Moriarty...Harper has also harnessed what captivates the Australian psyche - the landscape. The Dry is set in a small country town in drought, and this time she takes us into the bush. There are echoes of Picnic at Hanging Rock and Lord of the Flies as any appearance of civility slips away and the women lose direction in a hostile landscape.

Like Tana French&#39;s Dublin Murder Squad series and Kate Atkinson&#39;s Jackson Brodie novels, Jane Harper&#39;s deftly plotted mysteries double as sensitive inquiries into human nature, behavior, and psychology.

Finn, bestselling author of The Woman in the Window * Lord of the Flies in the Australian outback, with grown women in place of school boys. I loved every chilling moment of it.

And we&#39;re glad we did, because Force Of Nature is every bit as gripping as its predecessor. . . Don&#39;t miss it * NEW magazine * A gripping follow-up to her debut, The Dry * Good Housekeeping, Three Thrillers We Love * A three-day team-building hike in the Australian bush ends in disaster when the unpleasant Alice Russell disappears.

Once again there are plenty of suspects * Evening Standard * Jane Harper is more from the Patricia Highsmith and Donna Tartt school of mystery: elegant, intelligent and not for the faint-hearted...As chapters swap between the tense outward-bound weekend (where self-hatred, fear and resentment jostle for position) and its subsequent investigation, Harper creates a claustrophobic page-turner that conjures up that other great Australian mystery, Joan Lindsay&#39;s Picnic At Hanging Rock * Emerald St * Powerful, intriguing and recommended...Harper is wonderful at evoking fear and unease, and she draws a mesmeric picture of the terrifying Australian terrain * The Times * &#39;The most exciting emerging novelist of the last 12 months...As gripping, atmospheric and ingeniously plotted as The Dry, it places Harper in the elevated company of the authors she most admires: Val McDermid, Gillian Flynn and Lee Child * Mail on Sunday * Jane Harper, the new Queen of Crime...Even more impressive than The Dry...Harper makes it look easy but she has to pace two narratives without giving too much away, creating an almost unbearable level of suspense...Nature is a hostile, unpredictable force in both of Harper&#39;s novels, but her brilliance lies in making it into a test of horribly fallible human nature * The Sunday Times *</p><h2>The Victoria Vanishes: A Peculiar Crimes Unit Mystery</h2><p><b><br></b><i>Murder doesn&#x2019;t get more peculiar than this.</i> A lonely hearts killer is targeting middle-aged women at some of England&#x2019;s most well-known pubs.

It had been simply furnished with a few small tables, wooden booths and framed posters of old British courtroom movies. Mrs Curtis had been coming here for years, ever since she had first become a legal secretary, but every time she came through the door, she imagined her father's disapproval of her drinking alone in a London pub. It wasn't something a vicar's daughter should do.<br><br>Hemmed in by barristers and clerks, she could not help wondering if this was all that would be left for her now. She wanted to remain in employment, but companies had grown clever about making women of a certain age redundant. After her last pay-off, she had spent time working for a philosophical society instead of heading back into another large firm. Now she was waiting for&#x2014;what exactly? Someone to surprise her, someone to appreciate her, someone&#x2014;<br><br>She stared back into the melting ice cubes.<br><br>Her name was Naomi, but her colleagues called her Mrs Curtis. What was the point of having an exotic name if nobody used it? She was sturdy-beamed and rather plain, with thick arms and straight bangs of greying hair, so perhaps she looked more like a Curtis to others. If she had married, perhaps she would have gained a more appealing surname. She regretted having nothing to show for the past except the passing marks of time.<br><br>She checked the message on her cell phone again. It was brief and unsigned, but casual acquaintances sometimes called and suggested a drink, then failed to turn up; the legal profession was like that. Looking around the bar, she saw no-one she recognised. Friends usually knew where to find her.<br><br>'Give me another Gordon's, darling. Better make it a double.'<br><br>Adorable boy, she thought. The barman was impossibly slim, probably not much older than twenty-one, and didn't regard her with pity, just gave her the same friendly smile he bestowed on everyone else. Probably Polish; the ones who worked in bars now were quick to show pleasure, and had a rather old-fashioned politeness about them that she admired.<br><br>She touched her hair and watched him at work. She would never eat alone in a restaurant, but taking a drink by herself in a pub was different. Nobody knew her past here, or cared. For once, there were no tourists in, just the Friday night after-office crowd jammed into the tiny narrow rooms and spread out across the pavement on an unnaturally warm winter night. It had to be a lot colder than this to stop the city boys from drinking outside.<br><br>When she noticed him, it seemed he had been standing at her side for a while, trying to get served. 'Here,' she said, pushing back her stool, 'get in while you can.'<br><br>'Thanks.' He had a nice profile, but quickly turned his head from her, probably because of shyness. He was a lot younger than she, slightly built, with long brown hair that fell across his face. There was something distantly recognisable about him. 'Can I get you one while I'm here?' he asked. Rather a common voice, she thought. South London. But definitely familiar. Someone I've talked to after a few gins?<br><br>'Go on, then, I'll have another Gordon's, plenty of ice.'<br><br>He slid the drink over to her, looking around. 'I wonder if it's always this crowded.'<br><br>'Pretty much. Don't even think about finding your way to the toilets, they're up those stairs.' She pointed to the steep wooden passageway where a pair of tall prosecutors were making a meal out of having to squeeze past each other.<br><br>He muttered something, but it was lost in a burst of raucous laughter behind them. 'I'm sorry, what did you say?' she asked.<br><br>'I said it feels like home in here.' He turned to her. She tried not to stare.<br><br>'My home was never like this.'<br><br>'You know what I mean. Cosy. Warm. Sort of friendly.'<br><br>Is he just being friendly, she thought, or is it something else? He was standing rather too close to her, and even though it was nice to feel the heat of his arm against her shoulder, it was not what she wanted. In a pub like this everyone's space was invaded; trespass was part of the attraction. But she did not want&#x2014;was not looking for&#x2014;anything else, other than another drink, and then another.<br><br>He showed no inclination to move away. Perhaps he was lonely, a stranger in town. He liked the pubs around here, he told her, Penderel's Oak, the Old Mitre, the Punch Tavern, the Crown &amp; Sugarloaf.<br><br>'Seen the displays in the window outside this place?' he asked.<br><br>She turned and glanced at the swinging pub sign above the door, seven gold-painted stars arranged in a circle. The wind was rising. In the windows below, legal paraphernalia had been arranged in dusty tableaux.<br><br>'Wigs and gowns, dock briefs. All that stuff for defending criminals, nonces and grasses.' He spoke quickly, almost angrily. She couldn't help wondering if he'd had trouble with the police. 'I used to meet my girlfriend in pubs like this. After she left me I got depressed, thought of topping myself. That's why I keep this.' He dug in his pocket and showed her a slender alloy capsule, a shiny bullet with his name etched onto the side. 'It's live ammunition. If things get too much I'd use it on myself, no problem. Only I haven't got a gun.' He'd finished his beer. 'Get you another?'<br><br>She wanted more gin but demurred, protested, pushing her stool back by an inch. He seemed dangerous, unpredictable, in the wrong pub. He took her right arm by the elbow and guided it back onto the bar with a smile, but gripped so firmly that she had no choice. She looked around; most of the standing men and women had their backs to her, and were lost in their own conversation. Even the barman was facing away. A tiny, crowded pub, the safest place she could imagine, and yet she suddenly felt trapped.<br><br>'I really don't want another drink. In fact I think I have to&#x2014;' Was she raising her voice to him? If so, no-one had noticed.<br><br>'This is a good place. Nice and busy. I think you should stay. I want you to stay.'<br><br>'Then you have to let go&#x2014;' But his grip tightened. She reached out with her left hand to attract the attention of the barman but he was moving further away.<br><br>'You have to let go&#x2014;'<br><br>It was ridiculous, she was surrounded by people but the noise of laughter and conversation was drowning her out. The crush of customers made her even more invisible. He was hurting her now. She tried to squirm out of his embrace.<br><br>Something stung her face hard. She brought her free hand to her cheek, but there was nothing. It felt like an angry wasp, trapped and maddened in the crowded room. Wasn't it too early in the year for such insects?<br><br>And then he released her arm, and she was dropping, away through the beery friendship of the bar, away from the laughter and yeasty warmth of life, into a place of icy, infinite starlight.<br><br>Into death.<br><i><br>Chapter Two<br>The First Farewell<br></i><br>Early Monday in Leicester Square. On a blue-grey morning like this the buildings looked heavier, more real somehow in rain than in sunlight. Drizzle drifted on a chill breeze from the north-east. The sky that smudged the rooftops felt so low you could reach up and touch it.<br><br>John May, Senior Detective at the Peculiar Crimes Unit, looked around as he walked. He saw cloud fragments in lakes on broken pavements. Shop shutters rolling up. Squirrels lurking like ticket touts. Pigeons eating pasta. Office workers picking paths through roadworks as carefully as cats crossing stones.<br><br>The doorways that once held homeless kids in sleeping bags now contained plastic sacks of empty champagne bottles, a sign of the city's spiralling wealth. Piccadilly Circus was once the hub of the universe, but today only tourists loitered beside the statue of Eros, trying to figure out how to cross the Haymarket without being run over.<br><br>Every city has its main attraction, May thought as he negotiated a route through the dining gutter-parrots in the square. Rome has the Coliseum, Paris the Tour Eiffel, but for Londoners, Leicester Square is now the king. It seems to have wrested the capital's crown away from Piccadilly Circus to become our new focal point.<br><br>He skirted a great puddle, avoided a blank-faced boy handing out free newspapers, another offering samples of chocolate cake.<br><br>This is the only time of the day that Leicester Square is bearable, he thought. I hate it at night. The sheer number of people standing around, what do they all wait here for? They come simply because it's Leicester Square. There's not even a chance they'll spot Tom Cruise having his photo taken on a girl's cell phone, because everyone knows film premieres only take place on weeknights. There's nothing to see other than a giant picture of&#x2014;who is it this week?&#x2014;Johnny Depp outside the Odeon cinema, plus a very small park, the cheap ticket kiosk and those parlours selling carpet-tile pizzas that you could dry-stone a wall with. At least Trafalgar Square has Nelson.<br><br>The scene before him was almost devoid of people, and could not reveal the diegesis of so many overlapping lives. The city was shaped by assembly, proximity and the need for companionship. Lone wolves can live in the hills, but London is for the terminally sociable.<br><br>May caught sight of himself in a shop window. On any other day, he would have been pleased to note how neatly he fitted his elegant suit. He had remained fit and attractive despite his advancing years. His hair had greyed, but his jaw and waist were impressively firm, his colouring healthy, his energy level consistently high. All the more reason to be angry, he thought, but today he had good reason to be ill-tempered. He had just come to the realisation that he might very well be dying.<br><br>He tried not to think about the sinister manila envelope in his briefcase, about the X rays, the Leicester Square Clinic's referral letter, and what this meant to his future. For once he just wanted to enjoy London and think of nothing in particular, but the city wasn't letting him.<br><br>I remember when the square was different. Bigger and leafier, with cars slowly circling it and thousands of starlings fluttering darkly in the trees, that busker in a fez doing a sand-dance for coins outside the Empire. Look at the state of the place now. Kids need a purpose for coming here other than getting their iPods nicked. What will the next tawdry attraction be, I wonder, celebrity mud-wrestling or the National Museum of Porn? At least I won't be here to witness the indignities thrust upon it. I'll be long gone. I used to drink mild and bitter in The Hand &amp; Racquet with Arthur, then take a Guinness in the Green Man &amp; French Horn over in St Martin's Lane. I wonder if we'll ever do that again? I always thought he would go first, but what if it's me? What on earth will Arthur do then?<br><br>Bryant &amp; May. Their names went together like Hector and Lysander, like Burke &amp; Hare, unimaginable in separation. May still felt young although he was far from it. He still looked good and felt fit, but his partner in crime detection, Arthur Bryant, was growing old before his eyes. Arthur had all his critical faculties, far more than most, but the physical demands of the job were wearing him down. May wondered whether to hide his news from his partner for fear of upsetting him.<br><br>Despite his dark thoughts, May was still at his happiest here, walking to work through the city on a rainy February morning. Being near the idealistic young was enough to provide him with the energy to survive. He tried to imagine how visitors felt, seeing these sights for the first time. Every year more nationalities, more languages, and the ones who stayed on became Londoners. It was an appealingly egalitarian notion. More than anything, he would miss all of this. Culinary terms were appropriate for the metropolis; it was a steaming stew, a broth, a great melting pot, momentarily levelling the richest and poorest as they rubbed shoulders on the streets.<br><br>Striding between the National Portrait Gallery and St Martin in-the-Fields, he briefly stopped to reread the wording beneath the white stone statue of Dame Edith Cavell, the British nurse who faced a German firing squad for helping hundreds of soldiers escape from Belgium to the Netherlands. The inscription said: 'Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness for anyone.' If there's a more respectful creed by which to live, May thought, I can't imagine what it is.<br><br>He put the blame squarely on London and the strange effect it had on people. If he hadn't come here as a young man and met Bryant, he would never have been infected with his partner's passion for the place. He wouldn't have stayed here all these years, unravelling the crimes deemed too abstract and bizarre to occupy the time of regular police forces. And even now, knowing that it might all come to an end, he could not entertain the thought of leaving.<br><br>Curiosity finally got the better of him, and he stopped in the middle of the pavement to take out the envelope and tear it open. He could feel the letter inside, but did he have the nerve to read it?<br><br>A good innings, some would say. Let the young have a go now. Time to turn the world over to them. To hell with it. With a catch in his heart, he pulled out the single sheet of paper and unfolded it, scanning the two brief paragraphs.<br><br>A tumor attached to the wall of his heart, a recommendation for immediate surgery, a serious risk owing to past cardio-vascular problems that had created a weakness possibly leading to embolisms.<br>He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. Worse than he had expected, or better? Did he need to start planning for the inevitable? Should he tell anyone at the unit, or would it get back to Arthur?<br><br>You can't go, old bean, Bryant would say when he found out, and find out he would because he always did. Not without me. I'm coming with you. You're not going off to have the biggest adventure of all on your own. He'd mean it, too. For all his appearance of frailty Bryant was an extremely tough old man; he'd just recovered from wrestling a killer in a snowdrift, and all he'd suffered was a slight chest cold. But he wouldn't want to be left behind. You couldn't have one without the other, two old friends as comfortable as cardigans.<br><br>&nbsp;Damn you, London, this is all your fault, May thought, shoving the letter into his pocket and striding off through the blustering rain toward the Charing Cross Road.</p><h2>How to Develop Chi Power (Chinese Arts Series: 450)</h2><p>In this classic text, wing chun master William Cheung unravels the mystery behind the elusive energy of chi.

Cain to Stephen King, from Sophocles to the Marquis de Sade to Iceberg Slim, here are stunning and sometimes macabre visualizations of some of the greatest crime and mystery stories of all time. Rick Geary brings his crisp style to Dostoevsky's <i>Crime and Punishment</i>; C. Frakes resurrects the forgotten novella "Talma Gordon," the first mystery written by an African American. Crime finds new life in these graphic renditions of <i>The Arabian Nights</i>, the Bible, James Joyce's <i>Dubliners</i>, Patricia Highsmith, and leading mystery writers of today like Jo Nesb�. Crime and mystery have never been so brilliantly reimagined.</p><p><b>RUSS KICK </b>is the originator of the <i>Graphic Canon</i>&nbsp;series, for which he has commissioned new work from over 350 artists and illustrators, now going into its fifth volume. NPR descriped it as "easily the most ambitious and successfully realized literary project in recent memory." Kick's previous anthologies, <i>You Are Being Lied To </i>and<i>&nbsp;Everything You Know Is Wrong</i>, informed a whole generation of Americans with the hard truths of American politics and created a media frenzy for being the first to publish suppressed photographs of American flag-draped coffins returning from Iraq. The <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;dubbed Kick "an information archaeologist," <i>Details</i>&nbsp;magazine described him as "a Renaissance man," and <i>Utne Reader</i>&nbsp;named him one of its "50 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World." His popular website, thememoryhole2.org, is active again and getting national media coverage for archiving documents that the Trump administration has been deleting."Featuring adaptations of famous crime classics, most of which were created specifically for this volume, this work displays a range of absolutely stunning talent. From a relatively straight�forward depiction of the murder scene in Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Crime and Punishment</i>&nbsp;to a wildly experimental take on Stanley �Kubrick&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, editor Kick (<i>The Graphic Canon of Children&#x2019;s Literature</i>) presents a fantastic survey of the literature concerned with criminal activity, as well as a primer on everything possible in the graphic format. ...[A]s&nbsp;an introduction to the crime genre, this edition is second to none."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br>"From Poe to Kafka to Dostoyevsky, all the masters are here, in these short, graphic renderings of the darkest, most foreboding writing of all time. With different artists and illustrators taking on each tale, there are many revelations." &#x2014;Bret Stephens,&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> Book Review<br>"[Russ Kick] has managed to create something unprecedented in comic art... It is, for now, the most sustained anthology of comic art in the English language &#x2014; the best showplace of what comic art is today and what it can do. That&#x2019;s quite an accomplishment." &#x2014;Paul Buhle,&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Review of Books<br><br></i><br>&#x201c;Almost anything can be seen as a crime story, and almost anything can be adapted into a graphic novel. Few, however, have attempted such an ambitious and quirky melding of these two truths as editor and artist Russ Kick with his new anthology,&nbsp;<i>The Graphic Canon of Crime and Mystery</i>. This cleverly arranged series of graphic adaptations of classic mystery tales brings together a wide range of artists matched with a diverse list of stories, many of which are only loosely categorizable as crime fiction (that&#x2019;s part of the fun of it). With everything from biblical judgements to decadent poetry to 19th century classics, Kick and his army of artists have crafted a formidable and fascinating collection.&#x201d; &#x2014;Molly Odintz,&nbsp;<i>Lit Hub</i><br>&#x201c;This is a take on the crime &amp; mystery genre that proves quite refreshing and a true eye-opener. Russ Kick, in the role of curator/editor, has taken an offbeat path in order to emphasize just how diverse and unpredictable his subject can be. ... Kick manages to keep just the right unsettling vibe running throughout this impressive anthology.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Comics Grinder</i></p><h2>The Dal Cookbook</h2><p>2015 Gourmand Awards WINNER BEST INDIAN CUISINE<br>Dal is to India what pasta is to Italy. Cheap to produce, highly nutritional, suitable for long storage and capable of being cooked in a basic pot on an open fire, dal has been providing nourishment to millions of Indians for millennia. It truly is a pan-Indian dish consumed by rich and poor alike. It is high protein and has practically no sugar &#x2013; in fact it is known as &#x2018;poor man&#x2019;s meat&#x2019; in India &#x2013; hence doctors now include this as an essential item in a diet for diabetics. Dal is a genuinely impressive dish of infinite variety &#x2013; there are at least 50 recipes for this humble food. There are multiple ways of cooking it, wide-ranging seasonings are used and there are diverse supplements to serve with it. Over the centuries Indian cooks became innovative and with locally available ingredients they dished out dal to satisfy a regional palate. In the process they also invented new dishes using dal lentils such as kedgeree (khichari &#x2013; a risotto made with lentil), dosas (pancakes mixed with lentil flower), vadas (lentil cakes), dhokla (baked lentil cakes), papadam (dried lentil snack) and pakoras (fritters dipped in lentil batter).</p><p>Krishna Dutta, who was born in Calcutta, has lived for many years in London, where she works as a teacher.</p><h2>The Holographic Canvas</h2><p>The Holographic Canvas explores many possibilities one of which raises the question &#34;is Earth as we know it but a matrix or system of programs?

Through simple but riveting scientific explanations the reader is compelled to stretch his or her imagination.

The Holographic Canvas is a must read for anyone bold enough to go beyond the packaged concepts of reality! --Jordan Maxwell, Internationally known author/talk show host<br><br>The Holographic Canvas; While reading this book I was amazed by the depth of knowledge this author has on the subject. Having interviewed many people on the subject of the matrix we live in, I was taken back by the easy explanations offered by the author throughout the book. Anyone can understand what's really going on here on planet Earth by reading this book. It will expand your mind and conception of reality quicker than anything else you will read or view. Many claim to ;know how the system works, this author does. To truly understand life, you must understand all the programs and controls set up in the hologram we are currently traveling through.. this book will help the reader do just that. Highly recommend it. --Meria Heller, The Meria Show<br><br>Beautiful reading that is unique and informative, I loved this book. One of the most refreshing books I have read in a while, the Holographic Canvas reads like poetry-fluid and non-linear. Yet, it makes total sense and provokes deeper thinking as well as self-understanding. Freedom, autonomy and clarity of vision are the keywords I would use to categorize this book, if I had to categorize at all. Reading it is like stumbling upon a secret doorway. It's a unique book b/c it ties together economics, science, spirituality and every day living, while most books on 'spirituality' are very removed from the course of our day to day existence and what affects us directly. If you are looking for a new take on both old and new concepts, check out this book.

She hitchhiked her way around, travelling from Skye to Chamonix and many places in between, with all her possessions on her back, although these amounted to little more than a rope and a sleeping bag.When the money ran out, she worked as a forester, went winkle-picking on the Isle of Skye, acted as the helmsman of a schooner, and did a stint as an artist's model. And always there were the mountains, drawing her away from a "proper" job.Throughout this unique story, there are acutely observed accounts of mountaineering exploits as Moffat tackles the toughest climbs and goes on to become Britain's leading female climber&#x2014;and the first woman to qualify as a mountain guide.</p><p><b>Gwen Moffat</b> was the first woman to qualify as a mountain guide in the UK and is one of the greatest female climbers this country has ever produced.

His knowledge seemed pointless in a city where the night sky was usually barricaded behind an immense lid of low sulphurous cloud. When he looked up between the buildings, all he could see was a wash of reflected saffron light. But behind this he sensed the glimmering tracery of constellations, and could point to them with the certainty of a sailor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately it was a talent that impressed no-�one, least of all the girls from the Cromwell Estate in Bloomsbury, where he lived with his mother. Shirone Estanza was no different, and had stared blankly at him when he offered to name the stars, but she still pursued him. She was physically unlike most of the girls he had hung out with&#x2014;�shorter and rowdily brash&#x2014;�but she seemed like a lot of fun. She changed the colour of her nails every week (tonight, acid green) and wore the tightest skirts he&#x2019;d ever seen. But he was still finding his feet with girls, and couldn&#x2019;t be sure if he even liked them, or if they liked him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Romain appeared younger than his fifteen years. He had his father&#x2019;s flat nose and wide forehead, but never appeared intimidating because he was rail-�thin. He read voraciously, preferred heavy metal to hip-�hop, and wanted to study textile design at Central St&nbsp;Martin&#x2019;s. He saw movies about angry West Indian kids on council estates and failed to recognise anything of himself in the characters. His father had told him to be his own man, to keep close with his mates, to stay fit and fight back, pointless advice from a warehouseman who spent his days borrowing money from girlfriends, shuttling between the pub and the fixed-�odds terminals in betting shops.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For a kid with hardly any money, London is a city of closed doors. Astronomy was a free hobby. Romain could go to museums and libraries, and sit in parks on clear evenings, using the app on his mobile to identify constellations. Tonight, Shirone had insisted on paying for their drinks in The Gunmakers, a pub she could enter without being carded because one of her brother&#x2019;s best mates ran the bar. Although Romain had nowhere to take her now, it was a warm, muggy night, and as he had been running wild in the neighbourhood since he was old enough to stand, he knew every dark and secret space for miles around. Leading her down Wakefield Street into the narrow gloom of Henrietta Mews, he reached the closed iron gates of St&nbsp;George&#x2019;s Gardens and stopped, turning to her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shirone had folded her arms and was offering a defiant jut of the jaw. &#x2018;If you think I&#x2019;m going in there, you&#x2019;ve got another think coming.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x2019; Romain asked innocently. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s never anyone in here.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Been inside with a lot of girls, have you?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;No, what I mean is it&#x2019;s dead quiet and calm, all grass and trees an&#x2019; that, and sometimes it&#x2019;s dark enough to see the stars.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;You gonna start naming &#x2019;em all again?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;No, I just fancied a sit-�down with you. Look.&#x2019; He swung a long leg over the black iron railings and stepped lightly down inside. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s easy. There&#x2019;s never anyone in here. You need a hand over?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;I can manage.&#x2019; A moment later she had joined him and was looking around. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s nice, innit? You didn&#x2019;t say we was going to a graveyard.&#x2019; She pointed to the stone circle of sarcophagi that rose between the paths like sacrificial altars, and the broken line of verdigris-�topped headstones leaning against the back wall, under the shade of the plane trees. She had been in the little park many times but had never really taken much notice of the graves before. By day most of them were lost in the shadows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s a garden, it&#x2019;s not used for burials no more, not for ages.&#x2019; He ushered her past the headstones, towards a grassy area between the stone memorials. Tall buildings hemmed the park in on all sides. Here, at the backs of several blocks of flats, sheltered by the dense canopy of branches, they moved unobserved. Even the pale nimbus of the moon was lost from view. He dropped to the neatly clipped lawn and pulled out his mobile. She sat more gingerly, wary of ground that felt perpetually damp, even after a few days of dry weather.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;I got this tracking app that shows you the position of the planets,&#x2019; he said, tilting the light to her. &#x2018;See?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;How old are these graves?&#x2019; asked Shirone, twisting about. She was wearing stretch jeans and very high heels, and sitting on grass of any kind was a tentative activity at best.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;About three hundred years, maybe more.&#x2019; He returned his attention to the phone. &#x2018;See, Ursa Major is right overhead. In Greek mythology, Callisto got turned into a bear and was almost shot with an arrow by her son. He was turned into a bear, too. Ursa Minor. It&#x2019;s supposed to be the only constellation that never sinks below the horizon.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, whatever.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Something ticked down from a nearby tree, a bird releasing a twig, perhaps. Shirone looked as if she was about to spring to her feet. She had no problem pushing her way through a gang of ten classmates but more than three trees in the same place bothered her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Romain pulled a battered joint from his jacket pocket and dug for his lighter. &#x2018;I used to come here when I was little, for picnics and that.&#x2019; Perhaps it was best not to go on about the cemetery, he decided, as it would ruin his chances with her tonight, but he hadn&#x2019;t been able to think of anywhere else they could go. He dragged on the roll-�up and tried to pass it to her, but she pushed his hand away. The sound of a single car, heading south, broke the silence. The little park&#x2019;s greenery insulated it from surrounding noise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;I used to see you around all the time,&#x2019; said Shirone, &#x2018;but you never said nothing. I didn&#x2019;t think you liked me.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;It wasn&#x2019;t that, I just didn&#x2019;t know what to say. You was always with your brothers.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah. They&#x2019;d kill me if they found out I was here.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Why?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re joking, right? They&#x2019;re Italian. I&#x2019;m just half Italian.&#x2019; She laid herself awkwardly back on the grass. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s weird being in here at night. Like we&#x2019;re in the country. What&#x2019;s that park in New York?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Central Park.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah. My dad&#x2019;s got pictures. It&#x2019;s really big, right, but you can see buildings all around it.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;I s&#x2019;pose it was planned that way. Like a garden.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, but this&#x2019;&#x2014;�she gestured vaguely around the green&#x2014;�&#x2018;it&#x2019;s not, is it? It just got sort of left behind. I mean, it was here first, and everything else got built around it. Like it&#x2019;s the original land, and everything else is just&#x2014;�&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stopped her with a kiss. He wanted to take it slowly but there was something wonderful about her that he wanted to capture in his mouth. She tasted of mint and lemon; she had chewed the garnishes in her drink.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She broke off and turned her head. He thought he had made the wrong move, but then she raised a hand and said, &#x2018;Listen.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was somebody else in the grounds. He heard a scrape, a crack of wood, a grunt, a displacement of earth, a cascade of small stones. He pushed himself up from the ground and looked about. On the far side of the park there was a shuffle of movement, a black-�on-�grey shape that folded, rose and folded again. It almost looked as if something was coming out of one of the graves. It made him think of a Lucio Fulci zombie film, one of those once-�forbidden Italian B-movies that now looked so cheesy on YouTube.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What if Shirone&#x2019;s thuggish brothers had followed them in? She was fifteen years old, and he was lying on top of her beneath a pall of dope smoke.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Get off me,&#x2019; she whispered. &#x2018;Someone&#x2019;s here. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reluctantly, Romain rose. To get back to the railings they had to pass whoever was watching. Shirone grabbed the sleeve of his shirt and made him keep up with her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The curve of the path took them near the wall, the graves and the bushes. As they drew closer, the rowans shook abruptly and violently, scattering leaves and twigs. He could see a figure now, tall and angular, swaying drunkenly. &#x2018;Oi, mate,&#x2019; Romain called, &#x2018;what you doin&#x2019; there?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before any answer came Shirone ran forward, angry at being followed, and began shouting something about perverts. A moment later, her shout turned into a scream.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was hard for Romain to recall the exact order of events after that. Shirone stumbled into the torn-�up earth, twisting her ankle in the gap between the ground and the opened coffin. Romain tried to grab her and failed, knocked aside by the onlooker who had reached out an arm towards him. At some point he remembered seeing the raised lid, the muddy pit, a sliver of moonlight on the empty polished casket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He saw the man standing above him, middle-�aged, with greying hair and occluded eyes, clearly and irrevocably dead, dressed in his best black business suit, his arm still rising, the claw of his right hand extended as if to clutch at the living. Then the moon was unveiled from the clouds, highlighting his silvered pupils, his distended marbling flesh. The arm had risen high to point into the night sky, as if to transmit some dire warning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Romain could not believe what he was seeing. It was as if all the horror films he had been allowed to stay up late for as a child had rolled into one and come suddenly true. There, in the pale patch of moonlight, a cadaver had risen from the grave and was lurching stiffly through the penumbral gloom. The only way it could be any cooler would be if&#x2014;�</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And then that happened, too. The corpse spoke to him. He heard its grunted command and followed its pointing hand. And there in the night above him hung the answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a luxurious sense of panic began to burn through his stoned mellowness, Romain&#x2019;s senses registered everything at once: the overpowering smell of decay, the body lurching towards him from the grave with its outstretched arm, the putrid sighing of breath. Shirone was still yelling loudly enough to wake the dead single-�handedly, and now there was a bright square of bathroom light shining between the branches of the trees, high above the wall against which the row of ancient headstones leaned, in the little park where no-�one had stirred from beneath the ground in the last three hundred years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The body tottered forward and landed facedown in the earth. Suddenly Romain&#x2019;s excitement seemed absurd, and all he could think of was that he had been tricked and had missed his best chance with Shirone, and that even if they remained friends after this she would never let him touch her again, because a stupid reanimated corpse had spoiled it all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He glanced back at the dead body, inelegantly sprawled in the dirt, and grabbed Shirone&#x2019;s hand, which only made her scream more fiercely, so he let it go. She ran for the gate and virtually vaulted it. He followed her out onto the street, but then decided to go back, angered by his flight from something so strange and exciting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Wait here a sec,&#x2019; he told her. He needed to take another look.</p><p><br> --&nbsp; Michael S.

Yet his novels and plays masterfully appropriate and allude to an extensive range of literary works, demonstrating that McCarthy is well aware of literary tradition, respectful of the canon, and deliberately situating himself in a knowing relationship to precursors.</p><p>The Wittliff Collection at Texas State University acquired McCarthy's literary archive in 2007. In <i>Books Are Made Out of Books</i>, Michael Lynn Crews thoroughly mines the archive to identify nearly 150 writers and thinkers that McCarthy himself references in early drafts, marginalia, notes, and correspondence. Crews organizes the references into chapters devoted to McCarthy's published works, the unpublished screenplay <i>Whales and Men</i>, and McCarthy's correspondence. For each work, Crews identifies the authors, artists, or other cultural figures that McCarthy references; gives the source of the reference in McCarthy's papers; provides context for the reference as it appears in the archives; and explains the significance of the reference to the novel or play that McCarthy was working on. This groundbreaking exploration of McCarthy's literary influences&#x2014;impossible to undertake before the opening of the archive&#x2014;vastly expands our understanding of how one of America's foremost authors has engaged with the ideas, images, metaphors, and language of other thinkers and made them his own.</p></p><p>Michael Lynn Crews is an assistant professor of English at Regent University. He specializes in American and contemporary literature."This compendium of Cormac McCarthy&#x2019;s sources is remarkably complete. Any student of one of the great living American novelists would benefit immensely from having this volume. I particularly admire the rich gathering of background for the masterpiece <i>Blood Meridian</i>."

If Sepich&#x2019;s <i>Notes on &#x201c;Blood Meridian&#x201d;</i> has become the compendium necessary to the scholarly study of <i>Blood Meridian</i>, this book is clearly pitched as the compendium to the literary influences of McCarthy. It will provide a provocative jumping-off point for much relevant and exciting future scholarship." (Lydia R. Cooper, Creighton University, author of <i>No More Heroes: Narrative Perspective and Morality in Cormac McCarthy</i>)</p><h2>The Global Transformation of Time: 1870&#x2013;1950</h2><p><p>As new networks of railways, steamships, and telegraph communications brought distant places into unprecedented proximity, previously minor discrepancies in local time-telling became a global problem. Vanessa Ogle&#x2019;s chronicle of the struggle to standardize clock times and calendars from 1870 to 1950 highlights the many hurdles that proponents of uniformity faced in establishing international standards.</p><p>Time played a foundational role in nineteenth-century globalization. Growing interconnectedness prompted contemporaries to reflect on the annihilation of space and distance and to develop a global consciousness. Time&#x2015;historical, evolutionary, religious, social, and legal&#x2015;provided a basis for comparing the world&#x2019;s nations and societies, and it established hierarchies that separated &#x201c;advanced&#x201d; from &#x201c;backward&#x201d; peoples in an age when such distinctions underwrote European imperialism.</p><p>Debates and disagreements on the varieties of time drew in a wide array of observers: German government officials, British social reformers, colonial administrators, Indian nationalists, Arab reformers, Muslim scholars, and League of Nations bureaucrats. Such exchanges often heightened national and regional disparities. The standardization of clock times therefore remained incomplete as late as the 1940s, and the sought-after unification of calendars never came to pass. <i>The Global Transformation of Time</i> reveals how globalization was less a relentlessly homogenizing force than a slow and uneven process of adoption and adaptation that often accentuated national differences.</p></p><p>Vanessa Ogle is Julie and Martin Franklin Assistant Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania.The powerful lesson of Ogle&#x2019;s book is how the gradual global transformation of time over the course of the twentieth century came to suit many different parties, all of whom thought they had something to gain from new modes of integration and connectivity. The process we anachronistically call &#x2018;globalization,&#x2019; Vanessa Ogle shows, was made up of forces that often used international means to solve national or parochial problems. (Thomas Meaney <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>Ogle is more interested in the ways in which the concept of global time helped create what she calls a &#x2018;global imagination,&#x2019; in which peoples and societies could be understood as parts of a single, developing world system. In this way, Ogle argues, the standardization of time reflected and reproduced the world&#x2019;s European-led power hierarchies. International clocks and calendars united the world, but they also revealed and sometimes reinforced its inequities. (G. John Ikenberry <i>Foreign Affairs</i>)<br><br>Today, we take our global system of timekeeping largely for granted... Yet in her imaginative and thought-provoking new book <i>The Global Transformation of Time: 1870&#x2013;1950</i>, Vanessa Ogle reminds us that standardization and simultaneity had to be invented... Ogle&#x2019;s formidable work contributes to a new history of political economy which takes seriously the ideas, values, and acts of violence behind the emergence of global capitalism. (Ian P. Beacock <i>The Atlantic</i>)<br><br>How exactly horological chaos gave way to order is the subject of Ogle&#x2019;s accessible and prodigiously researched book...Ogle has insightful things to say about many topics, from the role of cosmopolitan ports in disseminating new kinds of timepieces, to Islamic calendars, to the curiously moralizing tone of early discussions of using daylight savings schemes to prevent people from squandering precious sunshine hours. Perhaps her most important contribution is to show, via discussion of the various ways that power relations shaped debates relating to time, how foolish it is to view globalization, in any period, as a smooth, value-free process of flattening out. (Jeffrey Wasserstrom <i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>With impressive breadth, imagination, and originality, Ogle has produced an important and genuinely global history of time that reveals the rhythms, directions, unevenness, and contradictory consequences of what we now call globalization. (Geoff Eley, University of Michigan)<br><br>Writing global history is still a high-stakes venture, and Ogle&#x2019;s <i>The Global Transformation of Time</i> is an impressive testimony to the potential of the genre. We get a deep sense of the talk about time and calendars among transnational experts and politicians as well as the everyday intelligence that produced differentiated time regimes&#x2015;times for travel, for work, for leisure, for religious practice or, as may be, for milking cows&#x2015;across the globe in Berlin and Beirut, London and Bombay, and their rural hinterlands. Reading this book is a tremendous intellectual pleasure from beginning to end. (Michael Geyer, University of Chicago)<br><br>Globalization is all the rage in the 21st century. What technology and cultural factors led to this shrinking world? One of the factors often overlooked, even taken for granted, is our system of uniform time...The progressives who advocated for uniform time found themselves dealing with nationalism, regionalism, and colonialism, as well as resistance from labor, religion, and other groups with a vested interest in the status quo. Ogle provides an intriguing glimpse into the machinations that led to the globalization of time. (T.

It contains familiar stories such as the birth of Christ, and the parables of the good Samaritan and the prodigal son. Its message about inclusivity and economic justice continue to empower many in their struggles for liberation. Luke is also noted for the prominence of women in its narrative. The general familiarity with Luke, however, may impede a true sense of what this Gospel is about as a whole. Thus, New Testament scholar Sharon Ringe offers readers a thorough introduction to and a critical reading of Luke. Readers will gain a renewed understanding of this Gospel in light of its whole message.</p><p>Books in the Westminster Bible Companion series assist laity in their study of the Bible as a guide to Christian faith and practice.

An originator of French "autofiction" of the 1990s, Guibert wrote with aggressive candor, detachment, and passion, mixing diary writing, memoir, and fiction. Best known for the series of books he wrote during the last years of his life, chronicling his coexistence with illness, he has been a powerful influence on many contemporary writers.</p><p><i>Written in Invisible Ink</i> maps the writer's artistic development, from his earliest texts&#x2015;fragmented stories of queer desire&#x2015;to the unnervingly photorealistic descriptions in <i>Vice</i> and the autobiographical sojourns of <i>Singular Adventures</i>. <i>Propaganda Death</i>, his harsh, visceral debut, is included in its entirety. The volume concludes with a series of short, jewel-like stories composed at the end of his life. These anarchic and lyrical pieces are translated into English for the first time by Jeffrey Zuckerman.</p><p>From midnight encounters with strangers to tormented relationships with friends, from a blistering sequence written for Roland Barthes to a tender summoning of Michel Foucault upon his death, these texts lay bare Guibert's relentless obsessions in miniature.</p></p><p>Herv� Guibert (1955&#x2013;1991) was a writer, a photography critic for <i>Le Monde</i>, a photographer, and a filmmaker.

She lives in Brisbane, Australia.<br><br>Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;This sequel to Kenneth Grahame's classic tale begins a year after the original. New arrivals Beryl, a mild mannered authoress, and Rabbit, a flighty rabbit, join Mole, Badger, Rat, and Toad on the River Bank. Toad, a reformed motorist, initiates a series of shenanigans when he becomes obsessed with obtaining a motorcycle, with Rabbit serving as an all-too-eager accomplice. Mole, initially avoidant of Beryl, is later revealed to be her brother and the two set off to save their friends from themselves, leaving behind a letter that leads Badger and Rat to believe the two have wed. The story ends with the merry band going head-to-head against a fox and his gang after Toad and Rabbit are captured. Johnson's attention to world-building and characterization create an engaging read with modern appeal while maintaining the aesthetic of the original. It also works as a stand-alone for new readers, though references to events covered in the first book are sprinkled throughout. Black-and-white line spot art and full-page spreads add to the nostalgic feel.

The author explores the relationship between these discussions and their historical and intellectual framework. Since there was in the medieval period a variety of traditions concerning the golem, it is plausible to assume that the techniques for creating this creature developed much earlier. This presentation focuses on the precise techniques for creating an artificial human, an issue previously neglected in the literature.<br><br> A complete survey of the conceptions of the golem in North European and Spanish literature in medieval times, allows not only better understanding of the phenomenon, but also of the history of Jewish magic and mysticism in the Middle Ages. The Jewish and Christian treatments of the golem in renaissance are explored as part of the renaissance concern for human nature.<br><br> This edition includes three new essays on the subject.</p><p><b>Moshe Idel</b> was Centennial Scholar in Residence at the Jewish Theological Seminary.

The final pieces include a moving talk on compassion in the time of AIDS, and the call to solidarity with the human family.</p><p>Every phrase of Henri Nouwen's life expressed his conviction that intimacy with Christ requires active involvement with powerless people in the world. This conviction is the organizing theme of <i>The Road to Peace</i>, edited by John Dear, which contains dozens of essays, interviews, and occasional writings. His reflections on the March on Selma in 1965, the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr., the legacy of Oscar Romero, and his work with handicapped people at the L'Arche communities are especially affecting. Because this book so thoroughly integrates Nouwen's spiritual beliefs and social concerns, <i>The Road to Peace</i> may be the best one-volume introduction to his work available. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>For more information on the life and works of Henri J.M.

It seemed quite shocking at the time that the design competition could be won by a twenty-one-year-old architecture student. Even more provocative, because her plan seemed so austerely postmodern, it failed to fulfill customary notions of what a suitably heroic memorial should look like. Hence the harsh criticism that a "black gash of shame" actually <i>dishonored</i> those who had died in Southeast Asia (fig. 4). A mere list of names placed in a wide-angle pit, with a plaque referring only to an "era" rather than an actual war? Could the nation do no better?Although H. Ross Perot had initially funded the design competition, he joined traditionalists in denouncing Maya Lin's winning entry and calling for a representational monument showing U.S. soldiers and an American flag. Secretary of the Interior James Watt, who had the power to veto the whole project, allowed it to go forward, but only on condition that a compensatory statue be commissioned and situated nearby (fig. 5). Watt forced his compromise on the federal Fine Arts Commission, which genuinely did not want to upstage Lin's design with what commission chairman and National Gallery of Art director J. Carter Brown called a "piece of schlock."By 1983 the interchange between Maya Lin and Frederick Hart, the sculptor for the figural addition, served only to intensify ill-feelings underlying two conflicting visions of what might be the most appropriate ways to memorialize a massive number of deaths in an unpopular war. When asked her opinion of Hart's work, Lin candidly replied: "Three men standing there before the world-it's trite, it's a generalization, a simplification. Hart gives you an image-he's illustrating a book." Hart became even harsher when asked whether "realism" was the only way to reach the disaffected veterans and politicians.The statue is just an awkward solution we came up with to save Lin's design. I think this whole thing is an art war. . . . The collision is all about the fact that Maya Lin's design is elitist and mine is populist. People say you can bring what you want to Lin's memorial. But I call that brown bag esthetics. I mean you better bring something, because there ain't nothing being served.In the decades since those two interviews took place, Americans have voted with their feet, but more powerfully with their hearts and minds. Lin is a winner.In 1987 Congress finally began its initial and pedestrian reaction to long-standing requests for a World War II memorial situated in a suitable place of honor in Washington, D.C. By the mid-1990s likely designs received a critical response for several reasons: first, they seemed too grandiose and therefore reminiscent of conservative monuments in Europe; second, they would likely obstruct the widely cherished two-mile vista between the U.S. Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial; and third, they would bisect the Mall by straddling its entire width. There were traditionalists on <i>both</i> sides of the issue: those who wished to preserve the uncluttered "purity" of the Mall and those eager to honor the "greatest generation" with a genuinely worthy plan consistent in merit with others in that coveted location. This conflict boiled up a full head of steam between 1997 and 2000, but Friedrich St. Florian's winning design finally received presidential approval when many pleaded that World War II veterans were rapidly dying and <i>something</i> should be completed before they had disappeared entirely (fig. 6).Too few Americans are aware that most of the issues raised between 1980 and 2000 had been hashed out long before when initial plans were unveiled for the Washington Monument and the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials. Moreover, major statues meant to honor Washington and Lincoln had also aroused the most intense feelings on similar grounds: sheer size (gigantism), style (classical versus "modern"), location, and even nudity in the case of Horatio Greenough's seated <i>George Washington</i>, commissioned by Congress in 1833, completed in Florence, Italy, in 1839, and placed in the Capitol Rotunda in 1841. Scale, style, site, and apparel (or lack thereof) would become persistent and volatile issues in American art ever after.<i> Monumental</i> is a more neutral euphemism for <i>gigantic</i> and <i>colossal</i>, of course. Many artists, sculptors, and architects who we might find guilty of gigantism were only striving to do monumental work. Suitable scale seems to lie in the eye of the beholder yet also reveals the ambitious needs of a principal stakeholder.Greenough's <i>Washington</i> touched off one of the earliest conflicts in the United States involving aesthetic criteria, and one of the most representative. A particularly problematic question involved style: how should the Father of His Country be depicted, as an idealized deity or as a revered native statesman? Classical or "American"? Godlike and spiritual or secular yet like-no-other? Greenough's solution turned out to be a hybrid: the head based upon Houdon's life mask certainly resembled Washington, but the body evoked Jupiter and Roman statuary (fig. 7). Hence the work got nicknamed George Jupiter Washington when it wasn't given more insulting designations. Greenough's inspiration was actually the Elean <i>Zeus</i> by Phidias, one of the greatest Greek sculptors, a work known only by description. Greenough was apparently seeking purity and simplicity rather than the pomposity that so many critics seemed to see in the statue. The snarls that ensued would demonstrate that compromise leaves almost no one satisfied.Greenough's statue as well as Robert Mills's Washington Monument emerged in the wake of failed attempts to commemorate the centennial of the founder's birth by unearthing his body from Mount Vernon for reburial in the Capitol crypt in 1832. The cult of Washington as a superheroic if not immortal figure remained exceedingly strong, though strife persisted over the relative merits of his role as a symbol of national unity and his symptomatic value to southerners as a Virginia-based protochampion of states' rights. The Nullification Crisis early in the 1830s, prompted by South Carolina's threatened secession over tariff issues, added sectionalism to the mix of aesthetic differences and complicated them. Similarly it has long been forgotten that several significant sources of friction in the decade following 1911 involving the Lincoln Memorial arose from sectional tensions left unresolved by the Civil War. That monument, which is virtually devoid of references to slavery and the conflict it generated, was meant to serve as an emblem of national unification. The intertwined boughs of southern pine and northern laurel that gracefully encircle the frieze provide just one indication of that quest. (Because laurel is a symbol of victory, of course, the northern Republicans who called the shots enjoyed a not-so-subtle triumph.)Serious debate would persist for more than a century following the 1820s: namely, whether monuments and architecture in the United States should pursue styles that feel native and new or should appropriate motifs from antique Greece and Rome. Horatio Greenough received interesting and revealing advice as he embarked upon his impassioned career as the premier American sculptor in the early republic. When he first attempted to model a figure of George Washington, he received wise counsel from a patron, the novelist James Fenimore Cooper: "Aim rather at the natural than the classical." That same heated issue would stay situated at the core of a decade-long quarrel over the most suitable design for the Lincoln Memorial. "Natural" meant more than avoiding stylistic imitation of the ancient world. It also meant having a heroic figure clothed in modern dress, and standing rather than seated like some emperor, Roman or Napoleonic.Greenough got mixed signals, however, because his fellow New Englander Edward Everett advised him to "go to the utmost limit of size. . . . I want a colossal figure." That muscular word <i>colossal</i> and its synonyms would recur over and over again in intensely heated discussions about the Washington Monument, the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials, and the memorial for Franklin Delano Roosevelt finally unveiled in 1997. Midwestern opponents of the Lincoln Memorial design that ultimately prevailed (albeit scaled back in size owing to considerations of cost and weight) pleaded instead for a "colossal statue" of the man who saved the Union. But in 1969 William Walton, chairman of the Fine Arts Commission, epitomized more than a century of polemics when he wrote to the chairman of the FDR Memorial Commission, a member of Congress: "I urge that we get away from bigness as a manner of memorializing great men. A man's place in history is never determined by the size of his monument."When Fenimore Cooper discovered the dimensions that Greenough had in mind, he considered them grandiose and advised his friend accordingly. The sculptor stuck with Everett's wishes, however, which reinforced his own aspiration, and designed a massive marble chair from which his seated Washington figuratively contemplated the ship of state he had brought into being. His gestures followed a classical formula seemingly well suited to a brand-new republic. Whereas Washington's right hand points heavenward, the source of law by which men live, the left hand returns his sword to the people because he has completed his service to them. It was not such a bad compromise, actually, between imperatives ancient and modern.Skeptics scoffed that the oversize statue would not even be able to enter the Capitol for placement in the Rotunda. They were wrong, and initial responses to the monumental piece in 1841&#x2013;42 seemed more favorable than not, though critics certainly made themselves known. When Greenough arrived from Florence in 1842 and saw how dim the Rotunda lighting was, however, he tried to have torches illuminate his work; but they only made matters worse. Flickering lights in a dim chamber do not enhance greatness. He then pleaded with Congress to move the monument out of doors so that it could be bathed in natural sunlight&#x2014;a serious error, as it turned out&#x2014;and that is when the harshest condemnations began to be heard. Maximum visibility only encouraged calumny.Fierce blasts came from Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, who had offered stiffer warnings than Cooper's concerning size as well as nudity, and from Philip Hone, the former mayor of New York, who recorded the following in his diary:It looks like a great herculean Warrier&#x2014;like Venus of the bath, a grand Martial Magog&#x2014;undraped, with a huge napkin lying on his lap and covering his lower extremities and he is preparing to perform his ablutions in the act of consigning his sword to the care of the attendant. . . . Washington was too prudent, and careful of his health, to expose himself thus in a climate so uncertain as ours, to say nothing of the indecency of such an exposure on which he was known to be exceedingly fastidious.Nathaniel Hawthorne was pithier: "Did anyone ever see Washington naked? It is inconceivable. He had no nakedness, but I imagine was born with his clothes on and his hair powdered, and made a stately bow on his first appearance in the world." Being unclothed from the waist up was nude enough for the 1840s but particularly so for the Father of His Country, a man renowned for his dignified reserve as well as other self-possessed qualities. On this matter also, however, consensus could not be achieved. Ralph Waldo Emerson described the work as "simple &amp; grand, nobly draped below &amp; nobler nude above." He declared that it "greatly contents me. I was afraid it would be feeble but it is not." In many different ways and for numerous reasons, nudity would become a prime cause of controversy during the century and a half that followed.Once it was determined that <i>Washington</i> would sit out of doors, exposed to extremes of weather and the uncontrollable excretions of birds, the figure became a prime target for pranksters. One inserted "a large 'plantation' cigar between the lips of <i>pater patriae</i>, while another had amused himself with writing some stanzas of poetry, in a style rather more popular than elegant, upon a prominent part of the body of the infant Hercules." Exactly which body part is unclear; but quite obviously political graffiti did not originate the day before yesterday. This monumental statue increasingly became an occasion for mockery, and Greenough's poignant letter to Robert Winthrop in 1847 sums up his frustration at having his motives and skills misunderstood by a nation so lacking in artistic sophistication.A colossal statue of a man whose career makes an epoch in the world's history is an immense undertaking. To fail in it is only to prove that one is not as great in art as the hero himself was in life. Had my work shown a presumptuous opinion that I had an easy task before me&#x2014;had it betrayed a yearning rather after the wages of art than the honest fame of it, I should have deserved the bitterest things that have been said of it and of me. But containing as it certainly<i> must</i> internal proof of being the <i>utmost effort</i> of my mind at the time it was wrought, its failure fell not on me but on those who called me to the task.Washington's state of undress also made him appear pagan&#x2014;not exactly proper in a society where evangelical Christianity enjoyed wide appeal. Although Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and many others praised it, the statue continued to inspire wags and scoffers throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century. The early rumor that it was too large to pass through the door of the Capitol gradually became a popular legend. Stories were repeated that it had to be moved outside because it threatened the very foundation of that big building and even that it sank the first ship that attempted to load it for "home" in Leghorn, Italy. The ultimate insult occurred in 1908 when Congress ordered that it be moved to the Smithsonian Institution's "Castle," ironic in turn because of Greenough's disdain for the Gothic style. A monumental mismatch of art and architecture.During the later twentieth century, when certain works of public sculpture became crazily controversial, such as Claes Oldenburg's <i>Free Stamp</i> in Cleveland, their defenders insisted that they could not be moved because they were "site specific," that is, designed with a very particular place in view. To change their venue would be tantamount to destroying them. This, too, was not a new issue. Greenough had been commissioned to create his work specifically for the Capitol Rotunda. It got moved outside at the sculptor's own request, though swiftly to his profound regret; and it was resituated once again more than half a century after his death. Relocation alone, however, had not denigrated it. Dissensus already had. The country simply could not agree on the most suitable aesthetic for honoring its foremost citizen with a prominently placed statue (fig. 8).</p><h2>Coltrane Chasin&#39; The Trane</h2><p>Always elusive, constantly moving, incessantly changing, John Coltrane stood astride the jazz world of the late &#x2018;50s and &#x2018;60s. He was a giant of the saxophone and a major composer. His music influenced both rock stars and classical musicians. There was a mystical quality, a profound melancholy emanating from this quiet, self-contained man that moved listeners&#x2014;some of whom knew little about music but heard something beyond music's boundaries in the sounds his saxophone created. J. C. Thomas traces John Coltrane's life and career from his North Carolina childhood through his apprenticeship with Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and Miles Davis, to its culmination in the saxophonist's classic quartet that played to steadily increasing audiences throughout America, Europe, and Japan.The author has drawn on the recollections of the people who knew Coltrane best&#x2014;boyhood friends, band members like Elvin Jones, spiritual mentors like Ravi Shankar, and the women who loved him.<i> Chasin' the Trane</i> is the story of a man who struggled against drug addiction, studied African and Eastern music and philosophy, admired both Einstein's expanding universe and the shimmering sounds a harp makes, and left behind the enduring legacy of a master musician who was also a beautiful man.</p><p><b>J.

Tall and savage upon the water, like mythical beasts, they sailed in, raining devastation and slaughter.<br><br>The fury of the Norseman was well-known along the Saxon coastlines of England. The Danes had wreaked havoc upon the land for years, and all Christendom had learned to stand and tremble at the sight of the swift dragon ships, the scourge of land and sea.<br><br>The ships came from the east that day, but no man or woman viewing the host of Viking ships that caught a wind that threatened sails, dared pause to ponder that fact. They saw the endless shields that lined the ships, prow and aft, and they saw that the wind, not the oarsmen, advanced the ships like the wrath of God.<br><br>Lightning sizzled and snapped and lit up the gray, swirling sky. The wind whistled and roared, and then screamed, as if to portend the blood and violence to come. Red and white, the Viking sails slashed across the dark and deadly gunmetal sky, defying the vicious wind.<br><br>Rhiannon was in her chapel when the first alarm was shouted. She prayed for the men who would do battle against the Danes at Rochester. She prayed for Alfred, her cousin and king, and she prayed for Rowan, whom she loved.<br><br>She had not expected danger to darken her coast. Most of her men were gone to serve with the king as the Danes were amassing to the south. She was without help.<br><br>"My lady!" Egmund, her most loyal, aging warrior, long of service to her family, found her in the chapel upon her knees. "My lady! Dragon prows!"<br><br>For a moment she thought he had lost his mind. "Dragon prows?" she repeated.<br><br>"On the horizon. Coming for us!"<br><br>"From the east?"<br><br>"Aye, from the east!"<br><br>Rhiannon leapt to her feet and raced from the chapel, finding the stairs to the wooden walls that surrounded her manor house. She hurried along the parapets, staring out to sea.<br><br>They were coming. Just as Egmund had warned her.<br><br>She felt sick to her stomach. She almost screamed in fear and agony. All of her life she had been fighting. The Danes had descended upon England like a swarm of locusts, and they had brought with them bloodshed and terror. They had killed her father. She would never forget holding him and willing him to breathe again. Alfred fought the Danes and defeated them often.<br><br>Now they were descending upon her home, and she had no one left to defend it because her people had gone to Alfred. "My God," she breathed aloud.<br><br>"Lady, run!" Egmund said. "Take a mount and ride hard to the king. You can reach him by tomorrow if you ride hard. Take your arrows and an escort, and I will surrender this fortress."<br><br>She stared at him and then smiled slowly. "Egmund, I cannot run. You know that."<br><br>"You cannot stay!"<br><br>"We will not surrender. Surrender means nothing to them&#x2013;they perform the same atrocities whether men give battle or not. I will stay and fight from here."<br><br>"My lady&#x2013;"<br><br>"I may kill or wound many of them, Egmund. You know that."<br><br>He did; she could see it in his eyes. She was an amazing markswoman. But she knew, too, as he looked at her, that he was still seeing her as the little girl he had protected for years.<br><br>Old Egmund wasn't seeing her as a child at all but as a woman, and he was afraid for her. Rhiannon was beautiful and striking, with a siren's silver-blue eyes and golden-sunset hair. She was Alfred's cousin as well as his godchild, and at his command she had been well educated. She could be softspoken and as gentle as a kitten, and she could trade quips and laugh with the men and manage the vast estates she had inherited with a charming ease. She would be a worthy prize for some Viking, and Egmund could not bear the thought that she might fall prey to such a man.<br><br>"Rhiannon, I beg of you! As I served your father&#x2013;"<br><br>Two steps brought her to him, and she flashed him a warm, beautiful smile, taking both of his gnarled hands into her own. "Dearest Egmund! For the love of God, I cannot fathom this attack from the east. I cannot! But I will not surrender, and I will not leave you here to die for me! I will flee when there is nothing more than can be done. But now, you must know that as my father's daughter I cannot leave until we have sent some of those heathens straight to hell! Call Thomas and order out what guard we have left, Egmund. Warn the serfs and the tenants. Hurry!"<br><br>"Rhiannon, you must stay safe!"<br><br>"Have my bow and a quiver of arrows sent to me. I shall not leave the parapet, I swear it!" she promised him.<br><br>Knowing further words would be useless, Egmund hurried down the wooden steps, shouting out orders. The huge gates were ordered shut, the few remaining warriors mounted their horses, and the simple farmers rushed about to find pitchforks and staffs. All looked terrified.<br><br>The brutality of the Vikings was well known.<br><br>A boy brought Rhiannon her quiver and arrows. She stared across the sea. The sky had grown gray and the wind was whipping fiercely, as if the elements were forecasting the horror soon to come. She saw the ships and trembled. Closing her eyes, she tried very hard not to remember the Viking raids of the past. She had lost so much to the Danes, as had England. She, too, was terrified, and yet she had to fight. To be taken or slain without fighting was not conceivable to her.<br><br>The attack made no sense at all. Alfred should have known something of the Danish movements. She should have been warned.<br><br>The ships moved closer and closer. The sky and sea seemed not to have the power to stop them.<br><br>Rhiannon nearly sank to her knees in fear. The ships were almost at the shore. The prows alone, with their hideously carved dragon faces, were enough to strike terror into most hearts. And still the sailors had not taken aim. Rhiannon prayed that her soldiers would let fly the first volley of arrows. Perhaps they could kill some of the invaders before the Vikings reached them. She closed her eyes in a brief prayer. Dear God, I am scared, please be with me.<br><br>She opened her eyes. She could see a man riding the lead ship. He was tall and blond and rode the tempest of the waves without losing his balance, his arms crossed over his chest. Certainly he was one of the commanders, towering in height, broad in the shoulders, lean in the hips, a strongly muscled warrior of Valhalla. She shivered anew and pulled out an arrow. Resolutely she stretched out her bow.<br><br>Her fingers trembled. She had never tried to kill a man before. Now she had to. She knew what Vikings did to men and women when they raided.<br><br>Her fingers slipped and a new trembling assailed her. Her mouth went dry and a frightening warmth overcame her. She closed her eyes and inhaled deeply, and when she opened them again, she didn't understand what had seized her. The wind seemed to be whispering to her that the golden-blond Viking was going to be part of her fate.<br><br>Impatiently she shook off the feeling and swore she would not tremble again. If it was difficult to aim at a man in order to kill him, she need only remember her father's death.<br><br>She tested her bow again, and her fingers were remarkably steady. Kill the leader, her father and Alfred had said often enough, and the men beneath him will scatter. This blond giant was one of their leaders. She had to kill him. And that was what the whisper of fate had been. She had to kill him, even if he seemed to defy the wind, the sea, and the gods, both Norse and Christian.<br>Eric of Dubhlain had no idea at that moment that his life might be in danger from anyone. He had not come to make war but at the invitation of Alfred of Wessex.<br><br>The sea was fierce, but he knew the sea and did not fear it.<br><br>The sky went black, and then the lightning came again, a startling streak of gold, as if God Himself had cast down a bolt of fire to light up the doom that approached. God or Odin, the Lord of the Viking horde, of his father's people, was at work. Odin was casting lightning bolts as he raced his black stallion Sephyr, and his chariot across the heavens. Odin, god of the pagans, was creating the storm, turning the sky to pitch, lighting it up again with blazes of sheer fire.<br><br>Eric stood tall and towering and powerful, like a golden god against the wind, a booted foot braced hard against the prow. The wind played against his hair, and it was as golden as the lightning, his eyes a blazing cobalt blue. His features were strongly chiseled, ruggedly, implacably handsome. His cheekbones were high and wide, his eyebrows set well upon his brow and cleanly arched, his jaw firm. His mouth, wide and sensual, was set in a straight line as he watched the shore. His beard and mustache were clipped and clean, redder than the hair upon his head, and his flesh was handsomely bronzed. He wore a crimson mantle, drawn closed with a sapphire brooch. He needed no fine garments to display his nobility, for his stature and the confidence of his stance made men tremble. The very air about him seemed charged, revealing his vitality. To maids of any race or creed he created a startling, arresting appearance. He was graced with extraordinary power in his muscles, in the breadth of his shoulders, in the width of his chest, and in the strength of his thighs. His belly was whipcord lean. His legs, hugging the tempest-tossed ship with ease, were as strong as steel from years upon the sea and years riding, running, fighting, and coming a-Viking.<br><br>Yet he was not the customary Viking, for he was the son of two races, the Irish and the Norse. His father, the great Lord of the Wolves, ruled as king in the Irish city of Dubhlain. Olaf, King of Dubhlain, had gone a-Viking in his time too. But he had fallen in love with the land and with his Irish wife, and he had brought about a curious peace with Eric's grandfather, the great Ard-Ri, or High King, of all Ireland. Eric's maternal grandfather, Aed Finnlaith, still ruled over all the Irish kings at Tara, and far away in the Norwegian icelands, Eric's father's father ruled as a great jarl of the Norse. His education had been well rounded. He had studied in great monasteries of learning with Irish monks, and he had learned about the Christian God and Christ, about writing, and about literature. At his father's court he had met many foreign men, masters and teachers. He had been taught to listen to the trees and the forest and the wind by Mergwin, the Druid. He had learned to reap, to harvest.<br><br>But he was a second son. He had gone to battle with his father and his elder brother, and he loved his Irish kin, but he had equally honored his Norse brethren. His Norse uncles, too, had taken him on many journeys for another kind of education.<br><br>A-Viking.<br><br>He had been bred to civilization, for men already proclaimed this time a "golden" age for Ireland.<br><br>He had also been bred to the raids that had made the savage quests of the Vikings famous throughout Europe and Asia and even the Russias. There were no finer navigators living than the Norsemen. There were no more furious fighters. And there were no men more brutal.<br><br>But he did not sail today to do battle. Though he had gone a-Viking with the best fighters in his younger days, he had also learned about a better quest, the one for land.<br><br>Eric had been sent to sea for the first time when he was just a lad, in the company of his uncle for whom he had been named. With his paternal grandfather's finest men, he had crossed endless seas and rivers and vast lands. He had sailed the Dnieper, entered into the gates of Constantinople, and learned the ways of the Moslem princes. He had come to know different cultures and peoples, and countless women, by conquest and by barter. A-Viking had been a way of life. It was what he did and what he was.<br><br>As the lightning lit up the heavens and the sea churned beneath him, as England's shore loomed ever closer, he wondered vaguely what had changed him. Not that the change had come quickly or easily. It had been like the slow melting of snows in the spring, entering into his heart and his being.<br><br>It had begun far, far from the northern icelands that were home to the Viking spirit. It had happened on the coast of Africa, when they had battled the caliph of Alexandria, and the people had come forward to pay with gold for their lives and their freedom.<br><br>She had been a gift to him.<br><br>Her name had been Emenia, and she knew nothing of rancor and hatred. She had taught him everything about peace. He had known only violence and she taught him tenderness. She had been taught the most exotic arts of lovemaking in the finest harem in the land, but it had been the sweet beauty in her heart, in her unquestioning devotion to him, that had lured him into love. She had enormous almond-shaped eyes, and hair as black as night, all the way down her back. Her skin was the color of honey, and she had tasted of it, and other sweet spices, and had smelled of jasmine.<br><br>She had died for him.<br><br>The caliph had been determined on treachery.

In his letter, on perfectly forged college stationery, &#x201c;Professor Manchin&#x201d; claimed to be a budding scholar of F. Scott Fitzgerald and was keen to see the great writer&#x2019;s &#x201c;manuscripts and papers&#x201d; during a forthcoming trip to the East Coast. The letter was addressed to Dr. Jeffrey Brown, Director of Manuscripts Division, Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, Firestone Library, Princeton University. It arrived with a few others, was duly sorted and passed along, and eventually landed on the desk of Ed Folk, a career junior librarian whose task, among several other monotonous ones, was to verify the credentials of the person who wrote the letter.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ed received several of these letters each week, all in many ways the same, all from self-proclaimed Fitzgerald buffs and experts, and even from the occasional true scholar. In the previous calendar year, Ed had cleared and logged in 190 of these people through the library. They came from all over the world and arrived wide-eyed and humbled, like pilgrims before a shrine. In his thirty-four years at the same desk, Ed had processed all of them. And, they were not going away. F. Scott Fitzgerald continued to fascinate. The traffic was as heavy now as it had been three decades earlier. These days, though, Ed was wondering what could possibly be left of the great writer&#x2019;s life that had not been pored over, studied at great length, and written about. Not long ago, a true scholar told Ed that there were now at least a hundred books and over ten thousand published academic articles on Fitzgerald the man, the writer, his works, and his crazy wife.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he drank himself to death at forty-four! What if he&#x2019;d lived into old age and kept writing? Ed would need an assistant, maybe two, perhaps even an entire staff. But then Ed knew that an early death was often the key to later acclaim (not to mention greater royalties).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a few days, Ed finally got around to dealing with Professor Manchin. A quick review of the library&#x2019;s register revealed that this was a new person, a new request. Some of the veterans had been to Princeton so many times they simply called his number and said, &#x201c;Hey, Ed, I&#x2019;ll be there next Tuesday.&#x201d; Which was fine with Ed. Not so with Manchin. Ed went through the Portland State website and found his man. Undergraduate degree in American lit from the University of Oregon; master&#x2019;s from UCLA; adjunct gig now for three years. His photo revealed a rather plain-looking young man of perhaps thirty-five, the makings of a beard that was probably temporary, and narrow frameless eyeglasses.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In his letter, Professor Manchin asked whoever responded to do so by e-mail, and gave a private Gmail address. He said he rarely checked his university address. Ed thought, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;re just a lowly adjunct professor and probably don&#x2019;t even have a real office.&#x201d; He often had these thoughts, but, of course, was too professional to utter them to anyone else. Out of caution, the next day he sent a response through the Portland State server. He thanked Professor Manchin for his letter and invited him to the Princeton campus. He asked for a general idea of when he might arrive and laid out a few of the basic rules regarding the Fitzgerald collection. There were many, and he suggested that Professor Manchin study them on the library&#x2019;s website.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The reply was automatic and informed Ed that Manchin was out of pocket for a few days. One of Manchin&#x2019;s partners had hacked into the Portland State directory just deep enough to tamper with the English department&#x2019;s e-mail server; easy work for a sophisticated hacker. He and the imposter knew immediately that Ed had responded.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ho hum, thought Ed. The next day he sent the same message to Professor Manchin&#x2019;s private Gmail address. Within an hour, Manchin replied with an enthusiastic thank-you, said he couldn&#x2019;t wait to get there, and so on. He gushed on about how he had studied the library&#x2019;s website, had spent hours with the Fitzgerald digital archives, had owned for years the multivolume series containing facsimile editions of the great author&#x2019;s handwritten first drafts, and had a particular interest in the critical reviews of the first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i>.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great, said Ed. He&#x2019;d seen it all before. The guy was trying to impress him before he even got there, which was not at all unusual. <br><br>2. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;F. Scott Fitzgerald enrolled in Princeton in the fall of 1913. At the age of sixteen, he was dreaming of writing the great American novel, and had indeed begun working on an early version of <i>This Side of Paradise</i>. He dropped out four years later to join the Army and go to war, but it ended before he was deployed. His classic, <i>The Great Gatsby, </i>was published in 1925 but did not become popular until after his death. He struggled financially throughout his career, and by 1940 was working in Hollywood, cranking out bad screenplays, failing physically and creatively. On December 21, he died of a heart attack, brought on by years of severe alcoholism.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1950, Scottie, his daughter and only child, gave his original manuscripts, notes, and letters&#x2014;his &#x201c;papers&#x201d;&#x2014;to the Firestone Library at Princeton. His five novels were handwritten on inexpensive paper that did not age well. The library quickly realized that it would be unwise to allow researchers to physically handle them. High-quality copies were made, and the originals were locked away in a secured basement vault where the air, light, and temperature were carefully controlled. Over the years, they had been removed only a handful of times.<br> &nbsp;<br> 3. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The man posing as Professor Neville Manchin arrived at Princeton on a beautiful fall day in early October. He was directed to Rare Books and Special Collections, where he met Ed Folk, who then passed him along to another assistant librarian who examined and copied his Oregon driver&#x2019;s license. It was, of course, a forgery, but a perfect one. The forger, who was also the hacker, had been trained by the CIA and had a long history in the murky world of private espionage. Breaching a bit of campus security was hardly a challenge.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Professor Manchin was then photographed and given a security badge that had to be displayed at all times. He followed the assistant librarian to the second floor, to a large room with two long tables and walls lined with retractable steel drawers, each of which was locked. Manchin noticed at least four surveillance cameras high in the corners, cameras that were supposed to be seen. He suspected others were well hidden. He attempted to chat up the assistant librarian but got little in return. He jokingly asked if he could see the original manuscript for <i>This Side of Paradise</i>. The assistant librarian offered a smug grin and said that would not be possible.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Have you ever seen the originals?&#x201d; Manchin asked. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Only once.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A pause as Manchin waited for more, then he asked, &#x201c;And what was the occasion?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, a certain famous scholar wished to see them. We accompanied him down to the vault and gave him a look. He didn&#x2019;t touch the papers, though. Only our head librarian is allowed to do so, and only with special gloves.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Of course. Oh well, let&#x2019;s get to work.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The assistant opened two of the large drawers, both labeled &#x201c;This Side of Paradise,&#x201d; and withdrew thick, oversized notebooks. He said, &#x201c;These contain the reviews of the book when it was first published. We have many other samples of later reviews.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; Manchin said with a grin. He opened his briefcase, took out a notepad, and seemed ready to pounce on everything laid on the table. Half an hour later, with Manchin deep in his work, the assistant librarian excused himself and disappeared. For the benefit of the cameras, Manchin never looked up. Eventually, he needed to find the men&#x2019;s room and wandered away. He took a wrong turn here and another one there, got himself lost, and eased through Collections, avoiding contact with anyone. There were surveillance cameras everywhere. He doubted that anyone at that moment was watching the footage, but it could certainly be retrieved if needed. He found an elevator, avoided it, and took the nearby stairs. The first level below was similar to the ground floor. Below it, the stairs stopped at B2 (Basement 2), where a large thick door waited with &#x201c;Emergencies Only&#x201d; painted in bold letters. A keypad was next to the door, and another sign warned that an alarm would sound the instant the door was opened without &#x201c;proper authorization.&#x201d; Two security cameras watched the door and the area around it.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Manchin backed away and retraced his steps. When he returned to his workroom, the assistant was waiting. &#x201c;Is everything okay, Professor Manchin?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh yes. Just a bit of a stomach bug, I&#x2019;m afraid. Hope it&#x2019;s not contagious.&#x201d; The assistant librarian left immediately, and Manchin hung around all day, digging through materials from the steel drawers and reading old reviews he cared nothing about. Several times he wandered off, poking around, looking, measuring, and memorizing.<br> &nbsp;<br> 4. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Manchin returned three weeks later and he was no longer pretending to be a professor. He was clean shaven, his hair was colored a sandy blond, he wore fake eyeglasses with red frames, and he carried a bogus student card with a photo. If someone asked, which he certainly didn&#x2019;t expect, his story was that he was a grad student from Iowa. In real life his name was Mark and his occupation, if one could call it that, was professional thievery. High-dollar, world-class, elaborately planned smash-and-grab jobs that specialized in art and rare artifacts that could be sold back to the desperate victims for ransom. His was a gang of five, led by Denny, a former Army Ranger who had turned to crime after being kicked out of the military. So far, Denny had not been caught and had no record; nor did Mark. However, two of the others did. Trey had two convictions and two escapes, his last the year before from a federal prison in Ohio. It was there he&#x2019;d met Jerry, a petty art thief now on parole. Another art thief, a onetime cellmate serving a long sentence, had first mentioned the Fitzgerald manuscripts to Jerry.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The setup was perfect. There were only five manuscripts, all handwritten, all in one place. And to Princeton they were priceless.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fifth member of the team preferred to work at home. Ahmed was the hacker, the forger, the creator of all illusions, but he didn&#x2019;t have the nerve to carry guns and such. He worked from his basement in Buffalo and had never been caught or arrested. He left no trails. His 5 percent would come off the top. The other four would take the rest in equal shares.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By nine o&#x2019;clock on a Tuesday night, Denny, Mark, and Jerry were inside the Firestone Library posing as grad students and watching the clock. Their fake student IDs had worked perfectly; not a single eyebrow had been raised. Denny found his hiding place in a third-floor women&#x2019;s restroom. He lifted a panel in the ceiling above the toilet, tossed up his student backpack, and settled in for a few hours of hot and cramped waiting. Mark picked the lock of the main mechanical room on the first level of the basement and waited for alarms. He heard none, nor did Ahmed, who had easily hacked into the university&#x2019;s security systems. Mark proceeded to dismantle the fuel injectors of the library&#x2019;s backup electrical generator. Jerry found a spot in a study carrel hidden among rows of stacked tiers holding books that had not been touched in decades.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Trey was drifting around the campus, dressed like a student, lugging his backpack, scoping out places for his bombs.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The library closed at midnight. The four team members, as well as Ahmed in his basement in Buffalo, were in radio contact. Denny, the leader, announced at 12:15 that all was proceeding as planned. At 12:20, Trey, dressed like a student and hauling a bulky backpack, entered the McCarren Residential College in the heart of the campus. He saw the same surveillance cameras he had seen the previous week. He took the unwatched stairs to the second floor, ducked into a coed restroom, and locked himself in a stall. At 12:40, he reached into his backpack and removed a tin can about the size of a twenty-ounce bottle of soda. He set a delayed starter and hid it behind the toilet. He left the restroom, went to the third floor, and set another bomb in an empty shower stall. At 12:45, he found a semi-dark hallway on the second floor of a dormitory and nonchalantly tossed a string of ten jumbo Black Cat firecrackers down the hall. As he scrambled down the stairwell, the explosions boomed through the air. Seconds later, both smoke bombs erupted, sending thick clouds of rancid fog into the hallways. As Trey left the building he heard the first wave of panicked voices. He stepped behind some shrubs near the dorm, pulled a disposable phone out of his pocket, called Princeton&#x2019;s 911 service, and delivered the horrifying news: &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a guy with a gun on the second floor of McCarren. He&#x2019;s firing shots.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Smoke was drifting from a second-floor window. Jerry, sitting in the dark study carrel in the library, made a similar call from his prepaid cell phone. Soon, calls were pouring in as panic gripped the campus.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every American college has elaborate plans to handle a situation involving an &#x201c;active gunman,&#x201d; but no one wants to implement them. It took a few dumbstruck seconds for the officer in charge to push the right buttons, but when she did, sirens began wailing. Every Princeton student, professor, administrator, and employee received a text and e-mail alert. All doors were to be closed and locked. All buildings were to be secured.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jerry made another call to 911 and reported that two students had been shot. Smoke boiled out of McCarren Hall. Trey dropped three more smoke bombs into trash cans. A few students ran through the smoke as they went from building to building, not sure where exactly the safe places were. Campus security and the City of Princeton police raced onto the scene, followed closely by half a dozen fire trucks. Then ambulances. The first of many patrol cars from the New Jersey State Police arrived.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Trey left his backpack at the door of an office building, then called 911 to report how suspicious it looked. The timer on the last smoke bomb inside the backpack was set to go off in ten minutes, just as the demolition experts would be staring at it from a distance.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At 1:05, Trey radioed the gang: &#x201c;A perfect panic out here.&nbsp;Smoke everywhere.

Introduction by Rupert Pole; Index; photographs.<br></p><p>Ana-s Nin (1903-1977) was born in Paris and aspired at an early age to be a writer. An influential artist and thinker, she was the author of several novels, short stories, critical studies, a collection of essays, two volumes of erotica, and nine published volumes of her Diary.Picking up where Henry and June (1986) left off, this portion of Nin's diary, which was cut from the expurgated editions published in her lifetime, records her steamy love affair with Henry Miller in Paris, but here her intense adoration gives way to disillusionment. She describes Miller as crude, egotistic, imitative, childishly irresponsible, "a madman." Her real focus, however, is her father, Joaquin Nin, a Spanish pianist and aristocratic Don Juan who seduced her after a 20-year absence. Her graphic account of their lovemaking and of her incestuous romantic feelings is fairly shocking. Nin sought absolution from her psychiatrist and lover, Otto Rank, who advised her to bed her father, then dump him as punishment for abandoning her when she was 10. Nin's ornate, hothouse prose is much rawer than the chiseled style of the expurgated diaries. She seethes with jealousy at Miller's wife June, swoons over poet and actor Antonin Artaud, neglects her protective husband, Hugh Guiler, and describes her traumatic delivery of a stillborn child. Her extraordinary, tangled self-analysis is a disarming record of her emotional and creative growth.

The story of the drove roads takesthe reader on an engrossing tour of Scottish history, from the lawless cattle driving by reivers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to the legitimate movement of stock which developed after the Union of the Crowns, by which time the large-scale movement of stock to established markets had become an important part of Scotland&#x2019;s economy, and a vital aspect of commercial life in the Empire.</p><p>Archibald Richard Burdon Haldane was born in 1900, the nephew of Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane.

Based on fresh examination of both the DNA and archeological evidence, they conclude that modern humans originated from Australia, not Africa.</p><p>The original Australians (referred to by some as Aborigines ), like so many indigenous peoples, are portrayed as &#x201c;backward&#x201d; and &#x201c;primitive.&#x201d; Yet, as the Strongs demonstrate, original Australians had a rich culture, which may have sown the first seeds of spirituality in the world. They had the technology to make international seafaring voyages and have left traces in the Americas and possibly Japan, Southern India, Egypt, and elsewhere. They practiced brain surgery, invented the first hand tools, and had knowledge of penicillin.</p><p>This book brings together 30 years of intensive research in consultation with elders in the original Australian community. Among their conclusions are the following:<br></p><ul><li>There is evidence that humans existed in Australia 40,000 years before they existed in Australia.</li><li>There were migrations of original Australians in large boats throughout the Indian/Pacific rim.</li><li>Three distinct kinds of Homo sapiens are found in Australia. </li><li>There is evidence from the Americas that debunks the out-of-Africa theory.</li><li>The spiritual influence of the Aborigines is reflected in the religions of the world.</li></ul><p></p></p><p><b>Steven Strong</b> is a secondary school teacher with a background in Aboriginal archaeology and education.

Among other controversial conclusions, the report has found that the CIA&#x2019;s enhanced interrogation techniques&#x201d; were not effective in acquiring intelligence to avert terrorist threats. The study also shows that the CIA misled the public, Congress, the Department of Justice, and even the White House on the effectiveness and the scope and severity of their interrogation techniques. The exhaustive and disturbing account also provides grisly accounts on horrific practices that occurred in CIA black sites: prisoners experienced sleep deprivation in stressful positions for up to 180 hours; being stripped and shackled, hooded and dragged down a long corridor while being punched; waterboarding; and rectal feeding.&#x201d;<br><br>Based on six million CIA documents and requiring $40 million to complete, the entire 6,000-page report still remains classified.

The obsessions of our own culture as the twentieth century came to a close resonate strikingly with those of the last fin-de-si�cle: crime, pollution, sexually transmitted diseases, gender confusion, moral depravity, alcoholism, and tobacco and drug use were topics of popular discussion then as now.</p><p><i>The Decadent Reader</i> is a collection of novels and stories from fin-de-si�cle France that celebrate decline, aestheticize decay, and take pleasure in perversity. By embracing the marginal, the unhealthy, and the deviant, the decadent writers attacked bourgeois life, which they perceived to be the chief enemy of art. Barbey d'Aurevilly, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Jean Lorrain, Guy de Maupassant, Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, Catulle Mend�s, Rachilde, Jean Mor�as, Octave Mirbeau, Jos�phin P�ladan, and Remy de Gourmont looted the riches of their culture for their own purposes. In an age of medicine, they borrowed its occult mysteries rather than its positivism. From its social Darwinism, they found their monsters: sadists, murderers, transvestites, fetishists, prostitutes, nymphomaniacs, and hysterics. And they reveled in them, completely upending the conventions of romance and sentimentality. <i>The Decadent Reader</i>, which includes critical essays on all of the authors, many novels and stories that have never before appeared in English, and familiar works set in a new context, offers a compelling portrait of fin-de-si�cle France.</p></p><p>Text: English<br> Original Language: FrenchThe end of the 20th century has renewed an interest in the end of the 19th century, in particular the aesthetes and fin-de-siecle writers of France who influenced writers like Oscar Wilde and pointed toward modernists such as James Joyce, Ezra Pound, and T.S. Eliot. Coined by Baudelaire to describe Edgar Allan Poe, Decadence represented an aesthetic/aristocratic attack on bourgeois culture, exploring themes of art, deviance, perversion, and marginalization. Editor Hustvedt has collected translations of 12 short novels or selections by Barbey d'Aurevilly, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, Remy de Gourmont, and six others. Each selection includes an introduction by the translator. Hustvedt has performed a valuable service by providing this rich assortment of materials not otherwise readily available.

Or a tedious one.<br>It all depends on what stage of the process you&#x2019;re taking part in.<br><br>� � �<br><br>Rigg and Father usually set the traps together, because it was Rigg who had the knack of seeing the paths that the animals they wanted were still using.<br><br>Father was blind to it&#x2014;he could never see the thin shimmering trails in the air that marked the passage of living creatures through the world. But to Rigg it was, and always had been, part of what his eyes could see, without any effort at all. The newer the path, the bluer the shimmer; older ones were green, yellow; the truly ancient ones tended toward red.<br><br>As a toddler, Rigg had quickly learned what the shimmering meant, because he could see everyone leaving trails behind them as they went. Besides the color, there was a sort of signature to each one, and over the years Rigg became adept at recognizing them. He could tell at a glance the difference between a human and an animal, or between the different species, and if he looked closely, he could sort out the tracks so clearly that he could follow the path of a single person or an individual beast.<br><br>Once, when Father first started taking him out trapping, Rigg had made the mistake of following a greenish trail. When they reached the end of it, there were only a few old bones scattered where animals had torn the carcass many months ago.<br><br>Father had not been angry. In fact, he seemed amused. &#x201c;We need to find animals with their skins still fresh,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;And a little meat on them for us to eat. But if I had a bone collection, these would do nicely. Don&#x2019;t worry, Rigg.&#x201d;<br><br>Father never criticized Rigg when it came to his knack for pathfinding. He simply accepted what Rigg could do, and encouraged him to hone his skill. But whenever Rigg started to tell someone about what he could do, or even speak carelessly, so they might be able to figure out that he had some unusual ability, Father was merciless, silencing him at once.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your life,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;There are those who would kill you for this. And others who would take you away from me and make you live in a terrible place and make you follow paths for them, and it would lead to them killing the ones you found.&#x201d; And, to make sure Rigg understood how serious this was, he added, &#x201c;And they would not be beasts, Rigg. You would be helping them murder people.&#x201d;<br><br>Maybe Father shouldn&#x2019;t have told him that, because it haunted Rigg&#x2019;s thoughts for months afterward&#x2014;and not just by giving him nightmares. It made Rigg feel very powerful, to think that his ability might help men find criminals and outlaws.<br><br>But all that was when Rigg was still little&#x2014;seven or eight years old. Now he was thirteen and his voice was finally changing, and Father kept telling him little things about how to deal with women. They like this, they hate that, they&#x2019;ll never marry a boy who does this or doesn&#x2019;t do that. &#x201c;Washing is the most important thing,&#x201d; Father said&#x2014;often. &#x201c;So you don&#x2019;t stink. Girls don&#x2019;t like it when boys stink.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s cold,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wash later, just before we get back home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll wash every day,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like your stink either.&#x201d;<br><br>Rigg didn&#x2019;t really believe that. The pelts they took from the trapped animals stank a lot worse than Rigg ever could. In fact, the stink of the animal skins <i>was</i> Rigg&#x2019;s main odor; it clung to his clothing and hair like burrs. But Rigg didn&#x2019;t argue. There was no point in arguing.<br><br>For instance, this morning, before they separated, they were talking as they walked through the woods. Father encouraged talking. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not hunters, we&#x2019;re trappers,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter if the animals run from us right now, because we&#x2019;ll catch them later, when they can&#x2019;t see us or hear us or even smell us.&#x201d;<br><br>Thus Father used their endless walks for teaching. &#x201c;You have a severe case of ignorance, boy,&#x201d; he often said. &#x201c;I have to do my best to cure that sickness, but it seems like the more I teach you, the more things you don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know everything I need to know already,&#x201d; Rigg always said. &#x201c;You teach me all kinds of strange things that have nothing to do with the way we live. Why do I need to know about astronomy or banking or all these languages you make me speak? I find the paths of animals, we trap them, we sell the furs, and I know how to do every bit of it.&#x201d;<br><br>To which Father always replied, &#x201c;See how ignorant you are? You don&#x2019;t even know why you need to know the things you don&#x2019;t know yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So tell me,&#x201d; said Rigg.<br><br>&#x201c;I would, but you&#x2019;re too ignorant to understand the reasons why your ignorance is a fatal disease. I have to educate you before you&#x2019;ll understand why it was worth the bother trying to tan your brain.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what he called their schooling sessions: tanning Rigg&#x2019;s brain.<br><br>Today they were following the trail of an elusive pench, whose pelt was worth ten otters, because penchfur was so thick and the colors so vibrant. During a brief lull in Father&#x2019;s endless teaching, during which he was presumably trying to come up with another problem for Rigg to work out in his head (&#x201c;If a board fence is nine hands high and a hundred and twenty yards long, how many feet of four-inch slat will you need to buy from the lumbermill, knowing that the slats come in twenty- and fourteen-hand lengths?&#x201d; Answer: &#x201c;What good is a nine-hand-high slat fence? Any animal worth keeping inside it can climb it or jump over it or knock it down.&#x201d; Then a knuckle on the back of his head and he had to come up with the real answer), Rigg started talking about nothing at all.<br><br>&#x201c;I love autumn,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;I know it means winter is coming, but winter is the reason why people need our furs so I can&#x2019;t feel bad about <i>that</i>. It&#x2019;s the colors of the leaves before they fall, and the crunching of the fallen leaves underfoot. The whole world is different.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The whole world?&#x201d; asked Father. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know that on the southern half of the world, it isn&#x2019;t even autumn?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I know that,&#x201d; said Rigg.<br><br>&#x201c;And even in our hemisphere, near the tropics it&#x2019;s never autumn and leaves don&#x2019;t fall, except high in the mountains, like here. And in the far north there are no trees, just tundra and ice, so leaves don&#x2019;t fall. The whole world! You mean the tiny little wedge of the world that you&#x2019;ve seen with your own ignorant eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all the world I&#x2019;ve seen,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;m ignorant of the rest, that&#x2019;s your fault.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You <i>aren&#x2019;t</i> ignorant of the rest, you just haven&#x2019;t seen it. I&#x2019;ve certainly <i>told</i> you about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, Father, I have all kinds of memorized lists in my head, but here&#x2019;s my question: How do you know all these things about parts of the world we can never ever see because they&#x2019;re outside the Wall?&#x201d;<br><br>Father shrugged. &#x201c;I know everything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A certain teacher once told me that the only truly stupid man is the one who doesn&#x2019;t know he&#x2019;s ignorant.&#x201d; Rigg loved this game, partly because Father eventually got impatient with it and told him to shut up, which would mean Rigg had won.<br><br>&#x201c;I know that I know everything because there are no questions to which I don&#x2019;t know the answer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excellent,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;So answer this question: Do you know the answers to the questions you haven&#x2019;t thought of yet?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve thought of all the questions,&#x201d; said Father.<br><br>&#x201c;That only means you&#x2019;ve stopped trying to think of new ones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There <i>are</i> no new questions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Father, what will I ask you next?&#x201d;<br><br>Father huffed. &#x201c;All questions about the future are moot. I know all the answers that are knowable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I thought. Your claim to know everything was empty brag.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Careful how you speak to your father and teacher.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I chose my words with the utmost precision,&#x201d; said Rigg, echoing a phrase that Father often used. &#x201c;Information only matters if it helps us make correct guesses about the future.&#x201d; Rigg ran into a low-hanging branch. This happened rather often. He had to keep his gaze upward, because the pench had moved from branch to branch. &#x201c;The pench crossed the stream,&#x201d; he said. Then he clambered down the bank.<br><br>Vaulting over a stream did not interrupt the conversation. &#x201c;Since you can&#x2019;t know which information you&#x2019;ll need in the future, you need to know everything about the past. Which I do,&#x201d; said Father.<br><br>&#x201c;You know all the kinds of weather you&#x2019;ve seen,&#x201d; said Rigg, &#x201c;but it doesn&#x2019;t mean you know what weather we&#x2019;ll have next week, or if there&#x2019;ll be a kind of weather you never saw before. I think you&#x2019;re very nearly as ignorant as I am.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; said Father.<br><br>I win, said Rigg silently.<br><br>A few minutes later, the trail of the pench went up into the air and kept going out of sight. &#x201c;An eagle got him,&#x201d; Rigg said sadly. &#x201c;It happened before we even started following his path. It was in the past, so no doubt you knew it all along.&#x201d;<br><br>Father didn&#x2019;t bother to answer, but let Rigg lead them back up the bank and through the woods to where Rigg first spotted the pench&#x2019;s trail. &#x201c;You know how to lay the traps almost as well as I do,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;So you go do it, and then come find me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t find you,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;You know I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know any such thing, because no one can <i>know</i> a false thing, one can only believe it with certainty until it is contradicted.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see your path,&#x201d; said Rigg, &#x201c;because you&#x2019;re my father.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s true that I&#x2019;m your father, and it&#x2019;s true you can&#x2019;t see my path, but why do you assume that there&#x2019;s a causal connection between them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it can&#x2019;t go the other way&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t be my father <i>because</i> I can&#x2019;t see your path.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have any other fathers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know of any other pathfinder like you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Therefore you can&#x2019;t test to see if you can&#x2019;t see the paths of your other fathers, because you don&#x2019;t have any. And you can&#x2019;t ask other pathfinders whether they can find their fathers&#x2019; paths, because you don&#x2019;t know any. So you have no evidence one way or another about what causes you not to be able to see my path.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I go to bed now?&#x201d; asked Rigg. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m already too tired to go on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Poor feeble brain,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;But how it could wear out I don&#x2019;t know, considering you don&#x2019;t use it. How will you find me? By following my path with your <i>eyes</i> and your <i>brain</i> instead of this extraordinary ability of yours. You&#x2019;ll see where I leave footprints, where I break branches.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t leave footprints if you don&#x2019;t want to, and you never break branches unless you want to,&#x201d; said Rigg.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re more observant than I thought. But since I told you to find me after the traps are set, doesn&#x2019;t it stand to reason that I will make it possible for you to do it, by leaving footprints and breaking branches?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Make sure you fart frequently, too,&#x201d; Rigg suggested. &#x201c;Then I can track you with my nose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bring me a nice switch to beat you with when you come,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;Now go and do your work before the day gets too warm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What will you be doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The thing that I need to do,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;When you need to know what that is, I&#x2019;ll tell you.&#x201d;<br><br>And they parted.<br><br>Rigg set the traps carefully, because he knew this was a test. Everything was a test. Or a lesson. Or a punishment from which he was supposed to learn a lesson, on which he would be tested later, and punished if he hadn&#x2019;t learned it.<br><br>I wish I could have a day, just a single day, without tests or lessons or punishments. A day to be myself, instead of being Father&#x2019;s project to make me into a great man. I don&#x2019;t want to be great. I just want to be Rigg.<br><br>Even taking great care with the traps, leaving them in each beast&#x2019;s most common path, it didn&#x2019;t take <i>that</i> long to set them all. Rigg stopped to drink, and then to empty his bladder and bowel and wipe his butt with leaves&#x2014;another reason to be grateful for the autumn. Then Rigg backtracked his own trail to the place where he and Father parted.<br><br>There wasn&#x2019;t a sign of where Father went. Rigg knew his starting direction because he had seen him go. But when he walked that way, Father had left no broken branches, no footprints, nothing to mark his passing.<br><br>Of course, thought Rigg. This is a test.<br><br>So he stood there and thought. Father might mean me to continue in the direction I saw him go when we parted, and only after a long time will he leave a mark. That would be a lesson in patience and trust.<br><br>Or Father might have doubled back as soon as I was out of sight, and left in another direction entirely, blazing a trail for my eyes to see, but only after I had walked blindly for a while in each random direction.<br><br>Rigg spent an hour doubling back again and again, so he could search for Father&#x2019;s signs of passing in every direction. No luck, of course. That would have been far too easy a challenge.<br><br>Again he stood and thought. Father listed the signs he could leave; therefore he isn&#x2019;t going to leave any of those signs. He&#x2019;ll leave different signs and my job is to be creative and think of what they might be.<br><br>Rigg remembered his own snotty remark about farts and sniffed the air, but he had only the ordinary human sense of smell and he couldn&#x2019;t detect a thing that way, so that couldn&#x2019;t be Father&#x2019;s game.<br><br>Sight and smell haven&#x2019;t worked. Taste seemed ludicrous. Could Father leave a clue using sound?<br><br>Rigg gave it a try. He stood in absolute stillness so that he could truly hear the sounds of the forest. It was more than holding his body still. He had to calm himself and concentrate, so that he could separate sounds in his mind. His own breathing&#x2014;he had to be aware of it, then move past it so he could hear the other sounds around him. Then the near sounds&#x2014;a scurry of a mouse, the scamper of a squirrel, the jarring notes of a bird&#x2019;s song, the burrowing of a mole.<br><br>And then he heard it. Very distant. A voice. A human voice. Impossible to know what words it was saying, if any; impossible to know if it was Father. But he could tell what general direction it was coming from, and so he moved that way, trotting along a path used by many deer so he could make good time. There was a low rise on the left that might block sound&#x2014;he wanted to get past that; he knew there was a stream to the right, and if he got too close to that the babble of the water might drown out the voice.<br><br>Then he stopped and went into stillness again. This time he was reasonably sure the voice was Father&#x2019;s. And he was more certain of the direction.<br><br>It took two more stops before he could hear the voice clearly enough to run continuously till he reached Father. He was saving up some choice criticisms of this tracking method when he finally reached the spot where the voice was coming from, a clearing where a large tree had recently fallen. In fact, the path of the falling tree was still sparkling blue. There was little occasion to follow plants, since they moved so little, except a bit of waving and bending in the breeze, but this tree must have fallen only a few hours ago, and the movement of its fall had marked a bright path through the air.<br><br>Rigg couldn&#x2019;t see Father at all.<br><br>&#x2018;&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>He expected some remark with a barbed lesson in it, but instead Father said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve come far enough, Rigg. You&#x2019;ve found me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I haven&#x2019;t, Father.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve come as close as I want you to. Listen carefully. Do not come any closer to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Since I don&#x2019;t know where you are&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; said Father.<br><br>Rigg fell silent and listened.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pinned under the tree,&#x201d; said Father.<br><br>Rigg cried out and to...</p><h2>Lord of Wicked Intentions (Lost Lords of Pembrook, 3)</h2><p><p>From <em>New York Times</em> bestselling historical romance author Lorraine Heath comes <em>Lord of Wicked Intentions</em>, the third and final chapter in the compelling Lost Lords of Pembrook trilogy.</p><p>The young, innocent victim of his uncle&#x2019;s madness, Lord Rafe Easton has learned not to depend on others, much less fall in love.

Malaparte began this impertinent portrait of Russia's Marxist aristocracy while he was working on <i>The Skin</i>, his story of American-occupied Naples, and after publishing <i>Kaputt</i>, his depiction of Europe in the hands of the Axis, thinking of this book as a another "picture of the truth" and a third panel in a great composition depicting the decadence of twentieth-century Europe. The book is set at the end of the 1920s, when the great terror may have been nothing more than a twinkle in Stalin's eye, but when the revolution was accompanied by a growing sense of doom. In Malaparte's vision it is from his nightly opera box, rather than the Kremlin, that Stalin surveys Soviet high society, its scandals and amours and intrigues among beauties and bureaucrats, including legendary ballerina Marina Semyonova and Olga Kameneva, sister of the exiled Trotsky, who though a powerful politician is so consumed by dread that everywhere she goes she gives off a smell of rotting meat. Unfinished at the time of Malaparte's death, this extraordinary court chronicle of Communist life (for which Malaparte also contemplated the title <i>God is a Killer</i>) was only published posthumously in Italy over fifty years after Malaparte's death and appears in English now for the first time ever.</p><p><b>Curzio Malaparte</b>&nbsp;(pseudonym of Kurt Erich Suckert, 1898&#x2013;1957) was born in Prato, Italy, and served in World War I. An early supporter of the Italian fascist movement and a prolific journalist, Malaparte soon established himself as an outspoken public figure. In 1931 he incurred �Mussolini&#x2019;s displeasure by publishing a how-to manual entitled&nbsp;<i>Coup d&#x2019;�tat: The Technique of Revolution</i>, which led to his arrest and a brief term in prison. During World War II Malaparte worked as a correspondent, for much of the time on the eastern front, and this experience provided the basis for his two most famous books,&nbsp;<i>Kaputt</i>&nbsp;(1944) and&nbsp;<i>The Skin</i>&nbsp;(1949). His political sympathies veered to the left after the war. He continued to write, while also involving himself in the theater and the cinema.<br><br><b>Jenny McPhee </b>is a translator and the author of the novels T<i>he Center of Things</i>, <i>No Ordinary Matter</i>, and A<i> Man of No Moon</i>.

The Great War rages overseas, and the whole of Europe, Africa, and western Asia is falling to the Central Powers. To win a war that must be won, Teddy Roosevelt, once again the American president, turns to his top secret Black Chamber organization--and its cunning and deadly spy, Luz O'Malley Ar�stegui. <br><br>On a transatlantic airship voyage, Luz poses as an anti-American Mexican revolutionary to get close--very close--to a German agent code-named Imperial Sword. She'll need every skill at her disposal to get him to trust her and lead her deep into enemy territory. In the mountains of Saxony, concealed from allied eyes, the German Reich's plans for keeping the U.S. from entering the conflict are revealed: the deployment of a new diabolical weapon upon the shores of America...</p><p><b>S. M. Stirling</b> is the author of many science fiction and fantasy novels. A former lawyer and an amateur historian, he lives with his wife, Jan.One<br><br> American National Airways<br><br> Dock One, Manhattan Airship Harbor<br><br> New York City<br><br> September 1st, 1916(b)<br><br> Point of departure plus Four Years<br><br> I've never flown before, Senior Field Operative Luz O'Malley Ar&#x2014;stegui thought.<br><br> She looked up at the docked airship, a study in light and shadow beneath the glare of the hangar's banks of lights, silver-bright above and reflected off the rippling water of the berth below.<br><br> And my first trip . . . three thousand miles over an ocean, to a continent at war!<br><br> At seven hundred fifty feet from nose to tail and a hundred forty across at its broadest point, the great silvery whale-shape of the San Juan Hill was the pride of American National Airways-four months out of the yard at Lakehurst and with its three sisters the only dirigibles in the world capable of routine transatlantic trips. The Battle class were a leap even for the brilliant, daring young engineering wizards of the National Aeronautical Administration, with a more advanced teardrop shape than any zeppelin and bigger too, larger even than the one that had spent a hundred hours in the air recently to reach German East Africa from Bulgaria despite the Entente air patrols.<br><br> And fortunately not one of their occasional brilliant daring failures, like that six-engine flying boat that kept crashing and sinking, or bursting into flames . . . and then crashing and sinking.<br><br> The airship above her was so large that its floating over the water seemed utterly unnatural, as if the giant silvery-gray thing were in an eternal mid-fall ready to topple down on you . . . though it was also a fragile lacework of aluminum covered in fabric, when you thought of Atlantic storms. The interior was vast, millions of square feet, but most of that was bags full of hydrogen and gas fuel for the ten engine pods.<br><br> She couldn't tell if the stirring she felt and the shiver on the back of her neck was excitement or apprehension. Not fear, certainly not that. Luz inhaled deeply; that smell of brackish harbor water, fuel oil, lubricants, and the doped cotton covering the giant flying machine was a new thing in the world. A coughing roar sounded as the engines began to turn over; the four-bladed aluminum propellers started to spin and the breeze of them went washing over her and tugging at her hat and skirt and fluttering cool fingers into her hair.<br><br> Excitement, verdad. Fear I leave for others . . . I left it behind with my childhood.<br><br> Luz wasn't afraid of much; she had never been timid, and what remained had been scoured out the night Pancho Villa's men burned the hacienda where her family had been staying, back before the Intervention.<br><br> Her face changed as she remembered, and for a moment her midnight-blue eyes might have been black, as the lighter streaks around the iris vanished. Remembered waiting in the back of the wardrobe in the dark, with the muzzle of the pistol pressed under her chin. Listening to the Villistas kill her parents while she swallowed her sobs, then crawling out on her belly like a snake below the worst of the smoke, past their machete-hacked bodies and through the sticky pools of their blood. Five years ago now . . .<br><br> "Miss?" the ticketing officer behind the counter of his kiosk said, alarm in his voice and a startled look in his eyes at what he'd seen in hers.<br><br> "Sorry," she said, blinking back to reality.<br><br> The stabs of uncontrollable memory were rare now. Now that every man involved was dead, including Villa. She'd watched most of them die, the ones she hadn't killed herself.<br><br> The agent was still puzzled by what he'd seen, frightened without knowing why. She gave him a charming smile as she handed over her passport along with the ticket.<br><br> The passport was forged in the name of one Elisa Carmody de Soto-Dominguez; there were more formalities to travel these days, what with the war, but the Black Chamber's documents section was on the job. Mexicans who wanted to travel abroad also had to get U.S. passports to do it, but that and the requisite dual citizenship were fairly easy to acquire for wealthy ones in good odor with the American authorities who ran the Mexican Protectorate now. Elisa had been one such, until the Chamber found out she was also a secret member of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario and conspiring with the German Empire against the United States.<br><br> While Luz traveled under her name, the luckless actual Elisa was either dead of what the file would say was heart failure-a .45 slug in the back of the head did make your heart fail very badly indeed-or still undergoing a series of exquisitely unpleasant experiences in El Palacio Negro de Lecumberri. The Black Palace of Lecumberri was a hulking ill-omened pile northeast of Mexico City that had been built as a prison by President Porfirio D&#x2019;az back around the turn of the century, and one that made her skin crawl every time she came near.<br><br> It had been the sort of place where you went for offending one of The Indispensible One's jefes pol&#x2019;ticos and slept tied upright to the walls because there were five thousand inmates in cells theoretically designed for seven hundred fifty. And there you stayed until you died or some guard made fifty pesos under the table by selling you to a labor agent from the tobacco estates of the Valle Nacional, which was about the same thing with fresh air.<br><br> It was still a prison for the Protectorate today, though much more select in its client list. It also housed the Black Chamber's southern headquarters, a Federal Bureau of Security station, and representatives from what she thought of as the Heinz 57 Varieties of military intelligence.<br><br> The ticket agent visibly relaxed under the beacon of her smile, dismissing the unguarded emotion he'd just seen in her eyes. Charming smiles were something Luz did well, along with other, hidden talents. She was in her mid-twenties, with straight fine hair the color of raven feathers, so black that it had metallic-blue highlights in the sun. It was done in the bobbed style the French actress Polaire had recently made fashionable among the daring, and framed a comely straight-nosed, full-lipped, olive-skinned oval face with high cheekbones under a round turban-style hat with a single peacock plume and a scarflike silk fall that was looped under the chin and fastened on the other side with a silver clasp.<br><br> Her clothes were modish but a little more conservative than the bobbed hair, a dark maroon tailleur outfit of jacket and lower-calf-length skirt of light worsted suited to the humid heat of New York's summer, with a cream silk shirtwaist and a few small pieces of day jewelry in the popular southwestern style. She'd picked those up in Santa Fe while debriefing from her last mission in a Black Chamber safe house.<br><br> Being obviously a bit of a dashing New Woman of the era of the New Nationalism was one thing, but she didn't want to stand out as a full-scale flapper with a cigarette in an ivory holder and a whiskey flask tucked into her garter. That would be bad tradecraft, both because it would attract attention and because it would be another layer of pretense she'd have to keep track of. It was much easier to disguise who you were than what you were. Like most of her generation and class Luz regarded the old Victorian conventions of Mrs. Grundy and her ilk with a degree of amused contempt and enjoyed herself without qualms, but she wasn't basically a frivolous person.<br><br> Thank God the corset is dead, though, she thought. My luck!<br><br> She'd just barely missed the period when you were a hopeless eccentric or a free-love advocate in odd-looking William Morris-style aesthetic gowns if you didn't start corseting by your late teens. The change had been very swift. Nobody her age wore one now, except dowdy lower-middle-class provincials who hadn't gotten the news or a few pinch-mouthed conservatives in enclaves like Beacon Hill in Boston where they tried to pretend the twentieth century hadn't started yet.<br><br> And thank God that looking active is fashionable now, too, everyone living Uncle Teddy's "Strenuous Life" or pretending to.<br><br> Her honorary uncle approved of strenuous women, too. Luz knew he meant it because she'd visited the Roosevelts often since girlhood; her father had been a Rough Rider and, as an MIT man who made his living as a consulting engineer in wild and woolly places, was just the type of scientific modern buccaneer the president admired.<br><br> I'd have been out of luck in the era of the tight-laced swoon and interesting pallor.<br><br> The middle-aged man in the blue uniform behind the booking booth's counter concealed any annoyance at her carefully calculated last-minute arrival and looked at the baggage the sweating porter had piled up behind her with his dolly. There were two expensive Vuitton steamer trunks in yellow leather with brass corners to go into the hold, and a large ostrich-hide suitcase and a hatbox by the same maker for the eighty-odd hours of the journey. They were plainly visible, since an airship boarding process wasn't the mob scene you'd get at Grand Central or Penn Station, especially when you were the last passenger to arrive. In fact there were several hundred people in the hangar, but they were mostly ground crew lost in the hugeness of it, disconnecting the lift gas and fuel gas and ballast water pipes and electric power cables and standing by the mooring lines.<br><br> None of them were paying her any special attention, except the corporal in charge of the very bored but reasonably alert Federal Bureau of Security squad in their new turtlelike steel helmets, baggy olive-dust-brown-green uniforms, and buckled gaiter boots.<br><br> He'd been giving her a few uneasy glances, his knobby narrow-chinned hillbilly face puzzled. He had a long scar over his sandy eyebrows, a very deep tan, an Arkansas toothpick tucked into his boot, and a drum-fed Thompson gun with a use-pitted muzzle in an assault sling across his belly. The rest carried the light self-loading rifles Browning had developed and Colt manufactured, or battle shotguns. The Bureau got their pick of the new toys, of which there were many these days since Uncle Teddy loved gadgets and inventions, particularly those that shot bullets. Or flew, or better still flew through the air shooting bullets.<br><br> His hand worked on the grip of the machine pistol as he frowned at her in puzzlement, and he was obviously listening to instincts that had kept him alive. She disarmed him with a brilliant smile and he flushed and looked away scowling, unable to match the inner prompting with what his eyes told him.<br><br> "You're traveling alone, then, Miss, ah, Carmody?" the ticketing officer said, grizzled brows rising on a face like the map of Ireland.<br><br> She nodded casually. Even in these enlightened modern days-and when years of war and Roosevelt's Equal Rights Amendment had changed many things-it was still just a little risqu for an obviously well-born young woman not to have even a maid with her, or an older traveling companion. Her mother's family, those stiff-necked birth-proud Cuban hacendado sugar barons, would have fainted in shock. But then they'd cut off her mother as if she were dead for eloping with the dashing young engineer Patrick O'Malley a quarter century ago, and she'd been raised very differently from the gloom and almost Oriental seclusion her mother had endured. Mima had enjoyed that adventurous tomboyish girl's life vicariously, even when she felt her daughter and only child was going too far and insisted on spells in finishing schools.<br><br> And besides, the Black Chamber doesn't have enough female agents to waste one playing my maid.<br><br> "If you'll stand here on the scale with your things, miss, we need to have the exact weight . . . ah, your cabin baggage is a bit over the maximum . . ."<br><br> She paid the stiff extra charge without a qualm; it fit her persona as an arrogant headstrong rich girl, which Elisa Carmody had been . . . though being a secret revolutionary had been arrogantly headstrong and very, very foolish. This was on Uncle Sam's nickel anyway, through the clandestine budget the Treasury funneled to the Secret Service and they to the Chamber, though she could have afforded it herself. Her father had left her the house and real estate in Santa Barbara and the ranchland near Los Olivos and enough income from conservative investments to finish her education at Bryn Mawr College and live very comfortably for the rest of her life, if not enough for the Upper Ten Thousand's social whirl. She'd chosen the Black Chamber instead because she wanted it. First for revenge, and then because . . .<br><br> Well, it would have been very dull to have nothing important to do. Even in Santa Barbara, where you can spend a month ambling around without noticing whether it's Friday yet. And I had to show Uncle Teddy he was right to trust me, and not let the other women in the Chamber down either. Peace someday . . . but not today.<br><br> A stamp on her passport ended the process. "That'll be cabin A-12, Miss Carmody . . . Miss de Soto . . . Miss . . . Dominguez . . ." he said, gradually running down as he ran through the names, mangling the Hispanic parts with a nasal big-city, East Coast, dese-and-dem accent probably acquired growing up in the Bronx.<br><br> "All three, technically, but Carmody will do," she said patiently.<br><br> Her own natural accent in English was pellucid General American of a Californian variety with a very faint western tinge, though she could have donned one that would make her sound like the man's younger sister. She was letting a very slight hint of both Mexico and Ireland into her speech, to match the report of Elisa Carmody's patterns.<br><br> He continued, with obvious relief at not having offended someone who could afford to spend better than his yearly salary on a ticket.<br><br> "Dinner will be served from seven, Miss Carmody. Welcome to the friendly skies of American National Airways, and have a swift and pleasant flight. Please follow the steward who will carry your cabin baggage."<br><br> She turned and strode with a gracefully springy step up the ramp that led to the gondola entrance, ignoring the passengers looking down at her disgracefully late arrival through the inward-curving windows of the lounge above; the three-level inhabited part of the airship was built into the bottommost curve of the hull save for where the semicircle of the flight deck jutted out like a chin near the underside of the prow.</p><h2>My Dearest Dietrich: A Novel of Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s Lost Love</h2><p><b>A staggering love illuminating the dark corners of a Nazi prison</b><br><br><i>Renowned German pastor and theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer is famous for his resistance to the Nazi regime and for his allegiance to God over government.

He was a boon companion to two other larger-than-life mountain men, Kit Carson and Jim Bridger, and just as important in frontier history. In 1829, our nineteen-year-old hero joined the Rocky Mountain Fur Company of Jedediah Smith and the Sublettes and headed west on an odyssey of hair-raising high adventure and hilarious low comedy. For the next twelve years, the Rockies rang with tales of Joe&#39;s wild exploits. After the Last Rendezvous in 1840, he helped drive the first wagons to Oregon, served in the legislature of the provisional government, and went to Washington as a special envoy to President Polk. He later returned to Oregon to live out his days in the community that he helped build. Stanley Vestal (1887-1957) wrote more than twenty books, including Jim Bridger: Mountain Man, also available as a Bison Book.</p><p>Born in Virginia, Joe Meek became trapper, Indian fighter, pioneer, peace officer, frontier politician, and lover of practical jokes and Jacksonian democracy.

And her otherwise sensible husband has announced that he&#39;s bored with teaching and ready for a career change.&#34; &#34;Say &#34;hello&#34; to P.I. Mike McQuaid and Associates. There aren&#39;t actually any &#34;associates&#34; - unless you count Ruby and China, of course. But the title does have a nice, official ring to it. His first client is Phoebe the Pickle Queen, owner of the biggest little pickle business in Texas. According to Phoebe, her plant manager is embezzling, and she wants McQuaid to follow the money.&#34; Meanwhile, Pecan Springs is hosting the annual Picklefest - and this year, China and Ruby are on the planning committee, along with Phoebe. But just days before the festival starts, the Pickle Queen disappears. Some say she sold her business and split; others think the answer may lie with her missing boyfriend. It&#39;s up to McQuaid and China to search for the Pickle Queen - and for clues in a case that promises to leave a very sour taste.</p><p><b>Susan Wittig Albert</b> grew up on a farm in Illinois and earned her Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley. A former professor of English and a university administrator and vice president, she is the author of the China Bayles Mysteries, the Darling Dahlias Mysteries, and the Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter. Some of her recent titles include<i> Widow&#x2019;s Tears</i>,<i> Cat&#x2019;s Claw</i>,<i> The Darling Dahlias and the Confederate Rose</i>, and <i>The Tale of Castle Cottage</i>. She and her husband, Bill, coauthor a series of Victorian-Edwardian mysteries under the name Robin Paige, which includes such titles as <i>Death at Glamis Castle </i>and <i>Death at Whitechapel</i>.Fans of the prolific Albert know that her China Bayles series delivers more than just a whodunit. Included in all of her "herbal" mysteries are several recipes--some featuring delicacies served at former lawyer China's Thyme for Tea shop and others featuring the herb showcased in the story. Dill takes center stage here, mostly in the form of pickles. Tiny Pecan Springs, located in the Texas Hill Country, is preparing for the gala tenth anniversary of Picklefest. China, whose husband, McQuaid, is launching a new PI business, is on the planning committee. Coincidentally, McQuaid's first client turns out to be Phoebe Morgan, the "Pickle Queen" whose family pickle business is the biggest in Texas. When Phoebe disappears before the festival, China and her best friend, Ruby, try to figure out where she went and why. Meanwhile, Ruby's daughter Amy is pregnant--and not divulging the father's name. As China learns more about the baby's father, Phoebe's disappearance, and an embezzlement scheme at Morgan's Premier Pickles, surprising connections are revealed. Readers will relish this more-sweet-than-sour adventure. <i>Jenny McLarin</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Some, like herself, are Latino immigrants and lesbians; others are men (gay and straight), people with AIDS, addicts, people living marginally, just surviving. As omniscient narrator to her characters&#39; lives, Obejas generously delves into her own memories of exile and alienation to tell stories about women and men who struggle for wholeness and love.</p><p><b>Achy Obejas</b> is also the author of <i>We Came All the Way From Cuba So You Could Dress Like This?</i> and <i>Days of Awe</i>. She has won numerous writing awards, including a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship and the 1996 Studs Terkel Journalism Award. She lives in Chicago.The down-to-earth stories in this debut collection from a Chicago Tribune columnist are pleasing, although they occasionally fail to connect to larger themes. Several of Obejas's narrators are lesbians trying to understand how relationships ought to work. In ``Wrecks'' the narrator explains that she regularly gets into car accidents when romance fades, and since her girlfriend has just left her she is preparing for a crash. The narrator of ``The Cradleland'' confides her fantasy of being ravished in a public bathroom and worries about safe sex even between lesbians since her (male) roommate and best friend is dying of AIDS. In ``Forever'' a lesbian activist trying to sort our her past (she says of her ex-lover, ``We're good lesbians: we've been painfully breaking up for two years'') subjects her current lover to ``the porch test,'' which means trying to imagine the two of them old together, sitting in a rocking chair on a porch. These are very accessible, sweet stories that, while appealing, do not have the lasting effect of the darker work here. The title story, the history of an immigrant Cuban family from the daughter's point of view, is more successful as well as more complex. Fragmented memories contain telling details, such as the summer the narrator's father finally buys a television set after insisting for years that it would be too difficult to transport one back to Cuba, and therefore symbolically accepts that they will remain in the US. ``Above All, a Family Man'' follows a dying man and his married lover as they drive from Chicago to Santa Fe. It both traces their relationship back to its origins and covers the married Rogelio's insistence that he cannot be at risk for AIDS because he is not gay. In ``Man Oh Man'' a heroin addict tells of the last time shooting up with a man named Ice who is now dead. Brings the marginalized front and center. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Jaine Rodack began collecting them from old magazines she would find at flea market sales. Those magazines of yesteryear reflected the fashions, commentaries, and views of times long gone. Rodack has assembled some of these magazine recipes into a wonderfully unique cookbook. Depending on the year they were written, their instructions differ greatly. In the late 1800s there were no controlled ovens and recipes said "cook til done". Fireless cookstoves and other now-forgotten inventions varied instructions as well. Rodack keeps as close to the original recipe as possible, although the adventurous chef may have to experiment a bit to get the head and cooking time straight. There are also household hints to try (or marvel at) and bits and pieces of memorabilia to let the reader know what was going on at the time these recipes first appeared. Forgotten Recipes is as much fun to browse through as it is to cook from! A perfect addition to any cookbook collection! --<i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Poems of Arab Andalusia</h2><p><p>These poems, from the astonishing 10th- through 13th-century civilization in Andalusia, are based on the codex of Ibn Sa'id, who wanted poems "whose idea is more subtle than the West Wind, and whose language is more beautiful than a fair face." Spanish readers have long been enchanted by their enduring appeal through the versions by Emilio Garc�a G�mez. This poetry of Arab Andalusia made a profound impact on Spain's Generation of &#x2018;27.

Now Bear continues his provocative tale of the human race confronted by an uncertain future, where &#x201c;survival of the fittest&#x201d; takes on astonishing and controversial new dimensions.<br><br> </b>Eleven years have passed since SHEVA, an ancient retrovirus, was discovered in human DNA&#x2014;a retrovirus that caused mutations in the human genome and heralded the arrival of a new wave of genetically enhanced humans. Now these changed children have reached adolescence . . . and face a world that is outraged about their very existence. For these special youths, possessed of remarkable, advanced traits that mark a major turning point in human development, are also ticking time bombs harboring hosts of viruses that could exterminate the &#x201c;old&#x201d; human race. <br><br> Fear and hatred of the virus children have made them a persecuted underclass, quarantined by the government in special &#x201c;schools,&#x201d; targeted by federally sanctioned bounty hunters, and demonized by hysterical segments of the population. But pockets of resistance have sprung up among those opposed to treating the children like dangerous diseases&#x2014;and who fear the worst if the government&#x2019;s draconian measures are carried to their extreme.<br><br> Scientists Kaye Lang and Mitch Rafelson are part of this small but determined minority. Once at the forefront of the discovery and study of the SHEVA outbreak, they now live as virtual exiles in the Virginia suburbs with their daughter, Stella&#x2014;a bright, inquisitive virus child who is quickly maturing, straining to break free of the protective world her parents have built around her, and eager to seek out others of her kind.<br><br> But for all their precautions, Kaye, Mitch, and Stella have not slipped below the government&#x2019;s radar. The agencies fanatically devoted to segregating and controlling the new-breed children monitor their every move&#x2014;watching and waiting for the opportunity to strike the next blow in their escalating war to preserve &#x201c;humankind&#x201d; at any cost.</p><p><i>Darwin's Children</i>, Greg Bear's follow-up to <i>Darwin's Radio</i>, is top-shelf science fiction, thrilling and intellectually charged. It's no standalone, though. The plot and characters are certainly independent of the previous novel, but the background in <i>Darwin's Radio</i> is essential to nonbiologists trying to understand what's going on. The next stage of human evolution has arrived, announced by the birth of bizarre "virus children." Now the children with the hypersenses and odd faces are growing up, and the world has to figure out what to do with them. The answer is evil and all too human, as governments put the kids in camps to protect regular folks from imagined dangers. Mitch and Kaye, scientists whose daughter Stella is swept up in the fray, become unwillingly involved in the politics that erupt around the issue of the new humans. Harrowing chases, gun battles, epidemics, and tense meetings about civil rights ensue, all brilliantly narrated. But just when you think you've got the book figured out, Bear throws a massive curveball by introducing... religion. That's right, a good old-fashioned epiphany, plopped down in the middle of a hard science fiction novel. But even skeptical readers will be swept along with Kaye as she tries to deal with what's happening to her and how it relates to the fate of her daughter's species. Keep reading past the words that make you uncomfortable--the hot science, the cool spirituality--and you'll be rewarded with a story of complete and moving humanity. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><b>Greg Bear</b> is the author of more than twenty-five books, which have been translated into seventeen languages.

Here is the vital and true story of the triumphant growth and its undying promise, shown with superb photography and told with exciting text. The utilitarian waterwheel, the great days of the steam sawmill, and the epic courage of the schooner masters are told in all their glory. Ralph Andrews augments his careful and thorough research with anecdotes of the men who transformed logs into the building materials of a nation. The reader takes a step back in time, as the history of the industry which has gone on continuously since 1825 is brought to life.</p><p>From his home in Seattle, Ralph Andrews has written many books to document American Northwest logging and its people.</p><h2>Hitchcock&#39;s Films Revisited</h2><p><p>When Hitchcock's Films was first published, it quickly became known as a new kind of book on film and as a necessary text in the growing body of Hitchcock criticism. This revised edition of<i>Hitchcock's Films Revisited</i> includes a substantial new preface in which Wood reveals his personal history as a critic--including his coming out as a gay man, his views on his previous critical work, and how his writings, his love of film, and his personal life and have remained deeply intertwined through the years. This revised edition also includes a new chapter on<i>Marnie</i>.</p></p><p>This is really two books in one. It contains the entire text of Robin Wood's groundbreaking <b>Hitchcock's Films</b> and supplements it with articles and commentaries on Hitchcock that Wood wrote from the time of that book's publication until today. Tracing the trajectory of Hitchcock's career, <b>Hitchcock's Films Revisited</b> also allows us to follow the intellectual and emotional development of one of the cinema's major critics. Wood's close readings are always revelatory and exciting, and this volume contains probably the best single essay ever written on a Hitchcock movie, Wood's analysis of <i>Vertigo</i>.Robin Wood, a founding editor of CineAction, is the author of <i>Sexual Politics and Narrative Film</i> (Columbia, 1998) and <i>Hollywood From Vietnam to Reagan</i> (Columbia, 1985), among other books.</p><h2>Christianity, Islam and the Negro Race</h2><p>2016 Reprint of 1887 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. As a writer, Blyden is regarded widely as the &#34;Father of Pan-Africanism&#34;. His major work, &#34;Christianity, Islam and the Negro Race&#34; (1887), promoted the idea that practicing Islam was more unifying and fulfilling for Africans than Christianity. He argues that Christianity was introduced chiefly by European colonizers. He believed it had a demoralizing effect, although he continued to be a Christian. He thought Islam was more authentically African, as it had been brought to sub-Saharan areas by people from North Africa. His book was controversial in Great Britain, both for its subject and because many people at first did not believe that a black African had written it.</p><p></p><h2>The Bayeux Tapestry: The Life Story of a Masterpiece</h2><p><p>One of Europe&#x2019;s greatest artistic treasures, the Bayeux Tapestry depicts the events leading up to the Battle of Hastings in 1066. For all its fame, its origins and story are complex and somewhat cloudy. Though many assume it was commissioned by Bishop Odo&#x2014;William&#x2019;s ruthless half-brother&#x2014;it may also have been financed by Harold&#x2019;s dynamic sister Edith, who was juggling for a place in the new court. In this intriguing study, medieval art historian Carola Hicks investigates the miracle of the tapestry&#x2019;s making&#x2014;including the unique stitches, dyes, and strange details in the margins&#x2014;as well as its complicated past. For centuries it lay ignored in Bayeux cathedral until its discovery in the 18th century. It quickly became a symbol of power: townsfolk saved it during the French Revolution, Napoleon displayed it to promote his own conquest, and the Nazis strove to make it their own. Packed with thrilling stories, this history shows how every great work of art has a life of its own.</p></p><p><p>Carola Hicks is the author of <i>Animals in Early Medieval Art</i>, <i>Discovering Stained Glass</i>, and <i>Improper Pursuits</i><i>.</i></p>&#x201c;I was bowled over...

They plan on using local foods-great news for city girl banker-turned orchard owner Meg Corey.

Alston argues that the perception of God&#x2015;his term for direct experiential awareness of God&#x2015;makes a major contribution to the grounds of religious belief. Surveying the variety of reported direct experiences of God, Alston demonstrates that a person can be justified in holding certain beliefs about God on the basis of mystical experience.</p></p><p>The late William P. Alston was Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Syracuse University.

The essays combine literary and philosophical commentary with clinical vignettes.</p><p>Adam Phillips was born in Cardiff in 1954. He is the author of numerous works of psychotherapy and literary criticism, including Winnicott, On Kissing, Tickling, and Being Bored, Going Sane, Side Effects, On Kindness, co-written with Barbara Taylor, On Balance, Missing Out, One Way and Another and Becoming Freud. Adam Phillips is a practising psychoanalyst and a visiting professor in the English department at the University of York. He writes regularly for the London Review of Books, the Observer and the New York Times, and he is General Editor of the Penguin Modern Classics Freud translations. His most recent book is Unforbidden Pleasures.Adam Phillips...writes about magnificently light subjects (kissing, tickling and, best of all, worrying) with a great deal of insight...He writes with farsighted equanimity about everything from solitude to spiders. In this regard, he's a bit like an Oliver Sacks of psychoanalysis, both affable and unalarmed. (Gail Caldwell <i>Boston Sunday Globe</i>)<br><br>A childlike freshness of vision informs these essays, which are at once compact, sophisticated, sharply knowing, yet almost provocatively casual, relaxed, amusing...[Phillips] is strikingly original and suggestive as a wry observer of psychoanalysis...[A] telling, engaging, brilliantly amusing and unsettling book. (Robert Coles <i>Raritan</i>)<br><br>In three superb books, <i>On Kissing, Tickling, and Being Bored</i>; <i>On Flirtation</i>; and <i>Terrors and Experts</i>...[Phillips] has endorsed pleasure as a laudable goal (imagine!) and enshrined narrative as a form of soul making. In the process, he's punched lovely skylights into the gloomy Freudian edifice and in general done much to rehabilitate the psychoanalytic enterprise by honoring the idiosyncrasy of human experience and by wielding method lightly, playfully, humanely. (Will Blythe <i>Esquire</i>)<br><br>Like Chekhov, Phillips writes as well as he doctors, and his fascination with the subtleties of human behavior makes him a good storyteller...He has a welcome openness to the essential strangeness of every person; this alone is reason enough to read him. (Jane Mendelsohn <i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>These are extremely insightful psychoanalytic essays on things like worry and solitude, which are of much more concern to me than issues like wanting to sleep with your closest relatives (Anne Enright <i>Irish Times</i>)</p><h2>Civil War Medicine (Illustrated Living History Series)</h2><p>Dr. C. Keith Wilbur takes you on a detailed and fascinating tour through the medical history of this bloody and devastating war.<br></p><p>The Civil War created both crises and opportunities never before imagined by the medical professional. Doctors of the time were not prepared to deal with the staggering number and nature of wounds inflicted. And often, absolute necessity mothered many inventions, from new surgical instruments to the logistics of providing ambulance service on the battlefield. The brutal reality of the war pushed doctors to a new level of medical and surgical knowledge. In Civil War medicine 1861-1865, Dr. C.

While stories of newly built but empty cities, white elephant state projects, and a byzantine shadow banking system, have all become a regular fixture in the press in recent years, McMahon goes beyond the headlines to explain how such waste has been allowed to flourish, and why one of the most powerful governments in the world has been at a loss to stop it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Through the stories of ordinary Chinese citizens, McMahon tries to make sense of the unique&#x2014;and often bizarre&#x2014;mechanics of the Chinese economy, whether it be the &nbsp;state&#x2019;s addiction to appropriating land from poor farmers; or why a Chinese entrepreneur decided it was cheaper to move his yarn factory to South Carolina; or why ambitious Chinese mayors build ghost cities; or why the Chinese bureaucracy was able to stare down Beijing&#x2019;s attempts to break up the state&#x2019;s pointless monopoly over the distribution of table salt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Debt, entrenched vested interests, a frenzy of speculation, and an aging population are all pushing China toward an economic reckoning. <i>China&#x2019;s Great Wall of Debt</i> unravels an incredibly complex and opaque economy, one whose fortunes&#x2014;for better or worse&#x2014;will shape the globe like never before.</p><p>"Dinny McMahon is one of the finest chroniclers of China's economic rise and this book - with its mixture of personal observation and sharp economic analysis - is a timely warning of the pitfalls that lie ahead for the world's most populous nation. A most provocative read."<i>Jamil Anderlini, Asia Editor for the Financial Times</i><i></i><i></i><br>"A superb, grassroots tour through the underworld of Chinese finance, an issue which -- much more than top-level power struggles or conflict with the United States -- could determine whether China becomes a true superpower or grinds to a halt under the weight of tons of bad debts."&nbsp;<i>Richard McGregor, award-winning journalist and author of Asia's Reckoning: China, Japan, and the Fate of U.S. Power in the Pacific Century</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;"China's Great Wall of Debt by Dinny McMahon puts red meat on the dry bones of standard economic analysis about China. From fake Moutai and Bobbie bears to how the government plays with its 'great ball of money,' his 10 years on the ground during a critical period enable McMahon to provide unique insight into China's precarious financial condition today and how it is likely to evolve&nbsp; tomorrow.

But to date, little attention has been paid to the ethnography of place, to how people actually live in, perceive, and invest with meaning the places they call home.</p><p>In this compelling new volume, eight respected ethnographers explore and lyrically evoke the ways in which people experience, express, imagine, and know the places in which they live. Case studies range from the Apaches of Arizona's White Mountains to the residents of backwoods "hollers" in Appalachia and the Kaluli people of New Guinea's rain forests. As these writers confront the dilemmas and possibilities of an anthropological consideration of place, they make an important and moving contribution to our understanding of ourselves.</p></p><p>Steven Feld, a MacArthur Fellowship recpient, is Professor of Anthropology and Music at the University of New Mexico.

He seeks to show how worship language and action lie behind much of the New Testament and how the modern church can gain a new power in worship through renewed reflection on the New Testament. Borchert first looks at the larger New Testament unit-gospels, Pauline letters, pastorals, etc. Then he takes each book in the section, passage by passage, and shows how worship constantly enters into the author&#39;s style and purpose in bringing that author&#39;s unique meaning to the individual context. He concludes each section with a terse Worship Summary of the biblical book and with questions for the reader to contemplate. Thus Borchert invites the reader to enter into the worship discussion and find ways to give depth, meaning, and hope to personal and congregational worship. At each step, Borchert underlines the deep connection between worship and life.</p><p>Gerald Borchert is thesis director at the Robert E. Webber Institute for Worship Studies, Jacksonville, Florida, and senior professor of New Testament at Carson Newman College, Jefferson City, Tennessee.</p><h2>The Art of the Islamic Garden</h2><p><b>Now in paperback, this lavish guide explains the design and symbolism of Islamic gardens while giving practical guidance to replicating&nbsp;the component parts</b>&nbsp;The Islamic garden is regarded as one of the highest forms of visual art in the civilization of Islam, and this guide explains&nbsp;these&nbsp;gardens' history and symbolism, and their connections to the Quran.

On impulse they buy Tarn Cottage in Brackdale, an idyllic valley in the Lake District that Daniel knew as a boy, a place so remote that the dead had to be carried out over the peaks on pack animals along the ancient Coffin Trail.</p><p>Tarn Cottage was once home to Barrie Gilpin, an autistic youth suspected of a savage murder. A young woman visitor to the valley had been found laid out on the Sacrifice Stone, an ancient pagan site up on the fell. Barrie fell to his death near the crime scene before he could be questioned. All these years later, Daniel retains his belief in Barrie's innocence and questions his own policeman father's handling of the case. When DCI Hannah Scarlett and her squad launch a cold case review, Brackdale's skeletons begin to rattle.</p><p>The wild geography of the Lakes District plays against local literary references, all backdrop to the lives of villagers and outsiders drawn to this beautiful spot&#x2015;but for what reasons? <em>The Coffin Trail</em> launches a new series by a master British hand.</p></p><p>Martin Edwards is an award-winning crime writer whose most recent novel, set in 1930, is Gallows Court.

He was elected eighth President of the Detection Club in 2015, is current Chair of the CWA, and posts regularly to his blog, 'Do You Write Under Your Own Name?'In this well-crafted whodunit from veteran British crime writer Edwards (<i>All the Lonely People</i>), Daniel Kind, a popular historian best known for a TV series that tries to solve historical mysteries using classic Holmesian deductive methods, decides to retreat from Oxford academia with his new love, Miranda. By chance, Miranda falls for a cottage in the Lake District that had once been the home of Kind's late friend Barrie Gilpin, a young sufferer of Asperger's syndrome. Gilpin was suspected of the gory ritualistic murder of an attractive woman on the Sacrifice Stone, a local landmark, but fell to his death before the police could question him. By yet another coincidence, Kind's late father was the senior investigating officer involved. Thanks to an anonymous informant, the father's prot�g�, DCI Hannah Scarlett, is about to reopen the old case. The renewed inquiry stirs up a hornet's nest and foments resentment toward Kind, whose amateur sleuthing is aimed at exonerating Gilpin. Despite the implausible setup and thin characterizations, Edwards's book is an interesting fair-play puzzler that will engage fans who like their contemporary crime in an English village setting. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"&#x2014; The Real Book Spy<br><br> "[A] headline-inspired thriller with a conservative slant."&#x2014;Publishers Weekly<br><br></b> After one of the most contentious and divisive elections in American history, the new president is finally settling into the West Wing. But when his chief of staff discovers evidence that voting machines in key counties in swing states were tampered with, the whole administration is in danger of unraveling. Did someone steal the election? Are America's enemies involved? Were the tampered-with machines actually rigged to swing the election the other way&#x2014;and if so and the plot failed, what is the conspirators' backup plan? <br><br> Jake Grafton and Tommy Carmellini race to solve the mystery of a potentially rigged election before Americans' full faith and credit in our democracy, sovereignty, and rule of law become completely undone."</p><p>Stephen Coonts is the author of 17 New York Times bestsellers. Mr. Coonts&#39; career took off with the publication of his wildly popular Vietnam War thriller Flight of the Intruder, which spent 28 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list and was later made into a blockbuster film starring Danny Glover and Willem Dafoe. Flight of the Intruder was inspired by Mr. Coonts&#39; own experiences flying an A-6 Intruder plane in Vietnam.<b>From Publishers Weekly:</b>:<br><br>"[I]n this second headline-inspired thriller with a conservative slant, [Coonts] sets his sights on the question of whether the 2016 election was rigged. Billionaire businessman Vaughn Conyer, a populist who's never held elective office, has defeated Cynthia Hinton, who was 'the establishment candidate, promising more of the same,' in an upset victory. Coonts's series lead, CIA director Jake Grafton, assigns his agent sidekick, Tommy Carmellini, to an FBI task force investigating election fraud. Hinton's supporters are claiming that foreign governments meddled in the election. Tommy is working with Maggie Miller, the special agent in charge of the task force, when they receive notice that a voting machine technician, Junior Sikes, has been jailed in Pennsylvania on kiddie porn charges and is willing to talk about his part in the voting machine chicanery. Before Junior can squeal, he and three others are whacked. Soon the body count stands at seven, and Tommy is dodging assassination attempts. Less vitriolic than Liberty's Last Stand, this outing should have broader appeal, though Trump fans will enjoy it most."<br><br><b>From The Real Book Spy</b>: "For those on the right, The Armageddon File should find its way to the top of your to-read list rather quickly. Coonts, who switched publishers prior to releasing last year's Liberty's Last Stand&#x2014;which is one of the most politically incorrect and controversial novels since Vince Flynn&#x2019;s Term Limits&#x2014;continues to write unfiltered, conservative-driven storylines that hold nothing back. The Armageddon File is a knockout blow to those who wish Coonts would tone down the politics, and his like-minded fans are sure to enjoy his unapologetic style. The stakes have never been higher for Grafton and Carmelini, as Stephen Coonts delivers another high-powered, politically-charged thriller that is not to be missed."</p><h2>Stories I Stole</h2><p>Fed up with working for Time magazine in London, Steavenson moved to Georgia on a whim.

Many of his books have an added dimension - die-cut pages, twinkling lights as in <b>The Very Lonely Firefly</b>, even the lifelike sound of a cricket's song as in <b>The Very Quiet Cricket</b> - giving them a playful quality: a toy that can be read, a book that can be touched. Children also enjoy working in collage and many send him pictures they have made themselves, inspired by his illustrations. He receives hundreds of letters each week from his young admirers. The secret of Eric Carle's books' appeal lies in his intuitive understanding of and respect for children, who sense in him instinctively someone who shares their most cherished thoughts and emotions.</p><p>The themes of his stories are usually drawn from his extensive knowledge and love of nature - an interest shared by most small children. Besides being beautiful and entertaining, his books always offer the child the opportunity to learn something about the world around them. It is his concern for children, for their feelings and their inquisitiveness, for their creativity and their intellectual growth that, in addition to his beautiful artwork, makes the reading of his books such a stimulating and lasting experience.</p><p>Carle says: "With many of my books I attempt to bridge the gap between the home and school. To me home represents, or should represent; warmth, security, toys, holding hands, being held. School is a strange and new place for a child. Will it be a happy place? There are new people, a teacher, classmates - will they be friendly? I believe the passage from home to school is the second biggest trauma of childhood; the first is, of course, being born. Indeed, in both cases we leave a place of warmth and protection for one that is unknown. The unknown often brings fear with it. In my books I try to counteract this fear, to replace it with a positive message. I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun."</p><p></p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Group (USA) Books for Young Readers.

This fascinating parallel biography of Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso as young men examines their greatest creations-Picasso&#39;s Les Demoiselles d&#39;Avignon and Einstein&#39;s special theory of relativity. Miller shows how these breakthroughs arose not only from within their respective fields but from larger currents in the intellectual culture of the times. Ultimately, Miller shows how Einstein and Picasso, in a deep and important sense, were both working on the same problem.</p><p><b>Arthur B. Miller</b> is Professor of History and Philosophy of Science, Department of Science &amp; Technology Studies, University College, London. He lives in London, England.Intellectual historians widely acknowledge that Einstein's theory of relativity and Picasso's cubist paintings launched modernity. Although the physicist and painter never met, their creative geniuses developed simultaneously under similar social circumstances and during an unrivaled period of cultural ferment. Moreover, Miller, professor of history and philosophy of science at University College London, contends, both Einstein and Picasso were deeply influenced by mathematician and philosopher Henri Poincar&#x201a;'s treatise on non-Euclidean geometry, La Science et l'hypoth&#x160;se. Both Einstein and Picasso borrowed from Poincar&#x201a; the idea of a temporal and spatial dimension beyond our own that could be captured in art and physics. Miller plunders previously unavailable sources as he narrates the parallel biographies of Einstein and Picasso. He traces in great detail the influences of photography, geometry and X-ray technology on Picasso's art as well as the influence of aesthetic theory on Einstein's science. Through close readings of the theory of relativity and Picasso's groundbreaking Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, Miller argues that these two men were working on the same problem: "how to represent space and time at just the moment in history when it became apparent that these entities are not what we intuitively perceive them to be." In the 21st century, it is old news that artists and scientists struggle with the best ways to represent space and time. But Miller's eloquent and wide-ranging interdisciplinary history of ideas returns us to the beginning of the 20th century when two brilliant minds challenged reigning understandings of space and time and fashioned revolutionary models that imbue contemporary culture's understandings of itself and the physical world.

Weaving together for the first time the histories of these black and white migrants, James Gregory traces their paths and experiences in a comprehensive new study that demonstrates how this regional diaspora reshaped America by "southernizing" communities and transforming important cultural and political institutions.<br><br>Challenging the image of the migrants as helpless and poor, Gregory shows how both black and white southerners used their new surroundings to become agents of change. Combining personal stories with cultural, political, and demographic analysis, he argues that the migrants helped create both the modern civil rights movement and modern conservatism. They spurred changes in American religion, notably modern evangelical Protestantism, and in popular culture, including the development of blues, jazz, and country music.<br><br>In a sweeping account that pioneers new understandings of the impact of mass migrations, Gregory recasts the history of twentieth-century America.

The kaleidoscopic <i>Kalevala</i> opens with the creation of the world and the birth of the ancient hero, V�in�m�inen, a being of supernatural origins. The work then turns to the relations between two communities: <i>Kalevala</i> (&#x2018;Land of the Kaleva&#x2019;&#x2015;the poetic name for Finland), led by V�in�m�inen, and <i>Pohjola</i> (&#x2018;Land of the North&#x2019;), ruled by Louhi, and old woman who can change into an avenging dragon...

While other sources have shown how British soldiers and civilians and the French-Canadian gentry (the seigneurs) responded&nbsp; to the American invasion of 1775&#x2013;1776, this journal focuses on French-Canadian peasants (les habitants) who made up the vast majority of the population; in other words, the journal helps explain why Quebec did not become the "fourteenth colony."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After American forces were expelled from Quebec in early 1776, the British governor, Sir Guy Carleton, sent three trusted envoys to discover who had collaborated with the rebels from the south. They traveled to fifty-six parishes and missions in the Quebec and Trois Rivi�res district, discharging disloyal militia officers and replacing them with faithful subjects. They prepared a report on each parish, revealing actions taken to support the Americans or the king. Baby and his colleagues documented a wide range of responses. Some habitants enlisted with the Americans; others supplied them with food, firewood, and transportation. Some habitants refused to cooperate with the king&#x2019;s soldiers. In some parishes, women were the Americans&#x2019; most zealous supporters. Overall, the Baby Journal clearly reveals that the habitants played an important, but often overlooked, role in the American invasion.</p></p><p><p>Michael P. Gabriel is Professor and Chair of the Department of History at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. He is also the author of <i>Major General Richard Montgomery: The Making of an American Hero.</i></p>&#34;Most historians assume that Canadians failed to support the American invasion of Canada in 1775. Through his superb introduction and editing of this largely unknown collection of reports by French Canadian seigneurs and priests, Michael Gabriel shows that only extensive controls and (relatively mild) punishments implemented by Governor Sir Guy Carleton and the French Canadian elite were able to prevent the Americans from receiving a good deal of support that was actually there. Gabriel&#39;s work makes the American invasion seem less foolish, more a plausible effort to liberate a sympathetic people than a blatant conquest, than it ever has in the historical literature. It also adds to the reputation of Carleton, one of the few competent generals the British possessed during the war.&#34;</p><h2>V is for Von Trapp: A Musical Family Alphabet</h2><p>From &#34;Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens&#34; to &#34;Doe, a deer, a female deer,&#34; many people have grown up humming the tunes or singing the lyrics to the songs from the beloved movie The Sound of Music.

This is his biography.</p><p>Before his death in 1832, Charles Carroll of Carrollton was widely regarded as among the most important of the American founders. Today, however, Carroll&#x2019;s signal contributions to the American founding are largely overlooked.&nbsp;In the fascinating new biography <b><i>American Cicero</i></b>, historian Bradley J. Birzer rescues Carroll from this unjust neglect. Drawing on his considerable archival research and study of Carroll&#x2019;s extensive correspondence, Birzer shows how this man of supreme intellect, imagination, and integrity recognized the necessity of independence from Great Britain well before most other founders, advocated a proper understanding of the American Revolution as deeply rooted in the Western tradition, inspired the creation of the U.S. Senate, and helped legitimize his religion, Roman Catholicism, in the American republic.&nbsp;Born a bastard, Carroll nevertheless became the best educated and wealthiest founder. His analysis of the situation in the colonies in the run-up to the Revolution, though ignored by almost all historians, was original and brilliant, Birzer shows. Carroll eventually served as one of the main informants for Alexis de Tocqueville&#x2019;s classic work <i>Democracy in America</i>.&nbsp;<b><i>American Cicero</i></b>reveals why founders such as John Adams assumed that Charles Carroll would one day be considered among the greats&#x2014;and also why history has largely forgotten him.<p>Bradley J.

Along the lane, the grassy verges bowed with their burdens of frost, and lacy collars of ice fringed the edges of the puddles. On the far side of the lane, beyond the hedgerow, the skeleton shapes of bare trees lined the boundaries of the fields. Stands of pale grass moved uneasily beneath metallic skies. Winter was stretching its fingers over the landscape, and if it had not yet drawn them in, to clasp the land fully in its grip, the time was surely near. <br> The street lamps along the lane were already on, shining through the grey light of the fading afternoon like tiny suns. Suspended in their light, ice crystals spiralled like shards of shattered glass. From the window of a small cottage, a man watched a girl&#x2019;s progress along the lane. The lace curtain hung from his fingertip like a veil. &#x201c;Prospect, Erin,&#x201d; he said without turning. The man&#x2019;s shoulders were hunched slightly, as if he might be expecting a strike from the tension that seemed to hang in the room like a presence. &#x201c;This could be the one.&#x201d; <br> From the armchair behind the man, Erin offered no opinion. A kitten mewled around the legs of the chair, looking for an affectionate pat that wasn&#x2019;t forthcoming. At the window, the man&#x2019;s eyes tracked the girl&#x2019;s approach carefully. She was perhaps eighteen, a youngish eighteen, though, slightly-built, with hardly an ounce of adult bulk on her delicate frame. He wondered if she was a runner. But there was no sign of well-developed muscle tone, no athletic spring in her step. Besides, it hardly mattered. Those boots she was wearing, all pointy toes and high heels, would not be much good for running over the uneven cobblestone surface of this laneway. Not that he intended to give her the chance. <br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said the man, nodding softly to himself, his eyes flickering slightly as he watched her. He could feel the pressure building in his chest. The hair at his collar was damp with sweat and the dryness in his mouth made it hard to swallow. Stage fright. He closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. He was surprised to find it affecting him like this. He had been over the scenario many times in his head. He should be calmer than this. But the heart holds surprises for even the most disciplined minds, and now the moment of truth was drawing close, the doubts were starting to flood in. <br> The girl was closer now, and he could see the wispy trail of her breath as she chatted on her phone. Distracted. Not ideal. He wanted her to know what was happening, to take it all in, to be aware of everything. His eyes moved to the greying sky beyond her, and then switched anxiously back and forth along the lane. No one. He turned his attention back to the girl, perhaps twenty metres away now, no more. If it was going to be this one, he had only a few seconds. Cap, jacket, open the door and run. Her head would spin around at the sound of his approach, just in time to see him bearing down on her. A momentary look of confusion on her face? Panic? Terror? And then. Over. It would be done. He could feel his pulse throbbing in his temples. This has to be done. His heart was racing. You have to do it. He clenched his fingers into his palm, feeling their wetness. But still he hesitated. <br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Erin. This one? Or not?&#x201d; <br> <i>Not.</i> <br> He let out a pent up breath and withdrew his finger, letting the curtains fall back into place with a delicate shimmer. From behind his lace screen, he watched the girl pass beneath the street lamp outside, still chatting on her phone. Her breath spiralled up in the cold air, seeming to him like whispered prayers, drifting up to heaven. She would never know how close she had come. <br> It was the light. It was important, perhaps the most important thing of all. It needed to be right, and it wasn&#x2019;t. Not yet. The man saw the mug on the window ledge in front of him and a bolt of alarm speared his chest. What if he had left it here, in his rush to get outside? He picked up the mug and carried it wordlessly into the kitchen. As he walked past the armchair, the kitten let out a small bleat. It looked for a moment as if it might follow the man into the kitchen, but in the end it jumped up onto Erin&#x2019;s lap and curled itself inside its tiny tail to go to sleep. <br> In the kitchen, the man set the empty, unwashed cup carefully in the sink. He peered out the kitchen window, checking the narrow garden as it ran down to the boat dock. He could feel the cold winter air coming in through the neat hole in the glass panel of the door. On the far bank of the river that ran behind the cottages, a pair of Mallards was hunkered down, blending in to the pale, brittle reed stems. Nothing else moved. <br> The man sat for a long time at the kitchen table, watching as the day retreated into the half-light of dusk. There was a large part of him that didn&#x2019;t want to do this. But something else had taken over. His actions were no longer his to control. His breathing had begun to quicken again. He steadied it. He felt tiny droplets of moisture running down his temples. Sweat. DNA. Bad thing. <br> He stood up quickly and walked back into the tiny, neat living room, now sheltering pockets of darkness in its corners. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll leave the lights off for now, Erin,&#x201d; he announced. He approached the bay window and peered through the curtains again. All the other cottages had lights on now. From outside, this one would look like a missing stone in the necklace of lighted windows that ran along the lane. <br> The man checked his reflection in the window glass; the brown leather jacket with its soft corduroy collar; the cap, tilted far enough forward to hide the plastic lining. And the greying goatee, with the little horns on the moustache. He gave the beard a downward stroke with his thumb and forefinger, as if to ensure it was in place. From the corner of his eye, he caught a flicker of movement, and he turned quickly to see a woman walking slowly down the lane, carefully picking her way between the puddles. Not up from the village as he had always envisioned it, but coming from the other direction. Panic started to rise within him. This was wrong. Why hadn&#x2019;t he ever considered this? Pull yourself together. What did it matter? She was taller than the other one and slightly older; a year or two. More woman than girl, this one. His mouth felt dry, and he dragged the back of his wrist across his lips. His breathing was shallow and rapid. A whisper of doubt flickered across his mind. Would she put up a fight? Try to grab him? No, he thought, the twilight, the shock; they would do their work. It would all happen the way he had planned it. <br> The woman was getting closer. Another fifty metres and she would be directly beneath the street lamp outside. Darkness all around and just that tiny pool of yellow light spilling onto the cobblestone lane like a spotlight on a stage. He watched her approaching. She had picked up her pace slightly and was hunched against the evening, as if something in her subconscious might be whispering about the dangers a quiet lane like this could hold. He wondered where she was going. Home after a hard day&#x2019;s work? To the pub to meet her friends? Or her boyfriend? It didn&#x2019;t matter. <br> Seated at the window, his right knee was bobbing up and down like a piston, resisting all his efforts to control it. His heart felt like it might explode from his chest. He was finding it hard to breathe. The mantra built in his mind, like the roar of an oncoming train. <i>This has to be done. You have to do it.</i> &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s where I have to leave you, Erin,&#x201d; said the man over his shoulder, not taking his eyes off the woman outside. His mouth was dry again and he licked his lips to moisten them. As the woman approached the pool of light beneath the street lamp, the man stood up. He ran to the front door and snatched it open. The door banged back against the wall of the cottage, but the woman was already looking in his direction &#x2014; that primeval mechanism, perhaps, alerting her to danger? It was already too late. The man sprinted toward her. She stared, frozen in terror, as he closed the gap. Less than five metres now, with no signs of slowing. The woman raised her hands defensively, bracing for the impact. The man exploded into her, lowering his head and smashing his cap into her face. The impact lifted the woman off her feet and sent her flailing back against the street lamp, snapping her head back hard against the post. Lying on the cold round. Stunned. She heard rapid footfalls; the sound of running. She raised her head and managed to focus in time to see the man sprinting away down the centre of the narrow lane. His escape rang off the cobblestones until, like the assailant himself, the sound finally disappeared into the night. From behind the screen of the net curtains, the sightlines from Erin&#x2019;s armchair to the street lamp were unobstructed. The woman was still on the ground, sobbing softly now, reeling from her injuries. She was beginning to shiver, too, as shock began to seep into the places where her fear had been. But Erin didn&#x2019;t go to her, or call out to check if she needed help. Nor did Erin reach for a telephone to call for an ambulance, or a police officer. Erin Dawes did not respond at all. The dead never do.</p><h2>A Season of Darkness: It Began with the Brutal Murder of Pure Innocence...

Now it's your turn." Two decades later, Terry Jennings finally completes the true story of his father's remarkable, unvarnished life with <em>Waylon: Tales of My Outlaw Dad. </em><br><br>Born when Waylon was only nineteen, Terry came of age just as Waylon's career hit the stratosphere with hits like "I've Always Been Crazy" and "Good Hearted Woman," one of his famous Willie Nelson duets. Terry dropped out of high school and joined his dad on tour, and the two became more like brothers than father and son. On the road, they toured with legends like Nelson, Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, and Jessi Colter, Waylon's fourth and final wife. Together father and son led a hard-partying lifestyle centered around music, women, and drugs. <br><br>Waylon's success--critical acclaim, bestselling albums, sold-out tours, and even TV stardom on <em>The Dukes of Hazzard</em>--was at times eclipsed by his demons, three divorces, crippling debt, and a depression that Terry traces to the premature death of Buddy Holly. (Waylon was supposed to be on Holly and Ritchie Valens's doomed flight.) Through it all, Terry worked on the touring crew, helped manage Waylon's career, and became one of his father's closest confidantes. Debunking myths and sharing incredible never-before-told stories, this book is a son's loving and strikingly honest portrait of his father, "the greatest Outlaw country musician to grace this earth" and an unlikely but devoted family man. <em>Waylon: Tales of My Outlaw Dad</em> will resonate for generations of fans.</p><p><strong>Terry Jennings</strong> is the CEO and founder of Korban Music Group LLC, a full service management, consulting, and publishing company. Well known for his varied experience at all levels of the music industry, Terry was introduced to the business at an early age through his work as production manager for his father, Waylon Jennings. He has also worked for booking agencies, publishing companies, and as a talent scout for major label companies, including RCA Records. He lives near Waco, Texas.<br><br><strong>David Thomas</strong> is author/writer of ten books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Wrestling for My Life</i> with WWE legend Shawn Michaels and <i>Foxcatcher--</i>the story that inspired the Oscar-nominated film--with Olympic gold medal-winner Mark Schultz. He lives near Fort Worth, Texas."Waylon Jennings and I first met in the mid '60s backstage at JD's in Phoenix. We would go on to record duets, write songs, cut records and tour together for over three decades. We had our differences, but our friendship always endured. I considered Waylon one of my best friends. Packed with funny, insightful tales of life on the road, this book is a terrific tribute, from a son to his father. A father who happens to be one of Texas and Nashville's greatest musicians. Every country music fan, Outlaw or otherwise, should have it on their shelf."&#x2015;<b><i>Willie Nelson</i></b><br><br>"I'm so excited about Terry's new book. Waylon Jennings has always been one of my favorite singers of all time. I loved his voice. He was completely different from anybody else. And I always wanted to either do a whole album with him or at least a duet song; but I never got the chance. That will always be one of my great regrets. Waylon was a wonderful human being as well. He reminded me very much of my own people in his tenderness, kindness, his understanding and his personality. I think of him often."&#x2015;<b><i>Dolly Parton</i></b><br><br>"I've played country music my whole life, and it's the evolutions (sometimes revolutions) that have ensured that it stays ever changing, ever growing, and constantly relevant. When I first heard Waylon sing the opening verse of 'Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way' it was like a mini sermon. It's also the first country song I played for my wife, and she was hooked immediately. As his son Terry wonderfully captures in this book, Waylon was an outsider trying to figure out how to be in a town like Nashville and stay true to his music and who he is. And, boy, can I relate to that. Waylon had a power, a gravitas to his music that hit me in a religious way. It was music where I could smell the beer soaked carpet, see the neon, feel the stomping and sliding of boots on hardwood floors, and almost taste the air thick with smoke, sex and whiskey. It's authentic, it's raw, and it's unapologetic in every way...and for a kid growing up on the other side of the world who never got to see Waylon 'live' or meet him, I feel like I've done both. God bless you Waylon ... and please know I'm taking great care of your leather-bound 1950 Broadcaster."&#x2015;<b><i>Keith Urban</i></b><br><br>"In his revealing new book, Waylon Jennings' son Terry discusses his father's legacy and what he really thought of the 'outlaw country' movement."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Wide Open Country</i></i></b><br><br> "<i>Waylon: Tales of My Outlaw Dad</i> is a quick, fun read that offers the reader an intimate look inside a world that doesn't exist anymore."&#x2015;<b><i>VICE</i></b><br><br>"[A] tender but lucid memoir that doesn't sugarcoat Waylon's raucous life."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Garden &amp; Gun</i></i></b></p><h2>Building Frameless Kitchen Cabinets</h2><p>Building Frameless Kitchen Cabinets&#34; is a complete building textbook for 32mm European style kitchen and bathroom cabinets.This long awaited book details design, hardware, joinery, 32mm system design, edge banding, cabinet doors, as well as full color photos and illustrations on uppers, base units, corner and tall cabinets.

Highlighting the gap between reports of coerced sex and incidents that were publicly classified as rape, Block demonstrates that public definitions of rape were based less on what actually happened than on who was involved. She challenges conventional narratives that claim sexual relations between white women and black men became racially charged only in the late nineteenth century. Her analysis extends racial ties to rape back into the colonial period and beyond the boundaries of the southern slave-labor system.

Traces of elaborate netting have been found in the tombs of ancient Egypt; the Bible mentions "fine twisted linen wrought with needlework"; and centuries-old Scandinavian burial chambers have yielded fragments of gold lace.<br>This definitive history of lace-making is a landmark of nineteenth-century erudition and scholarship that has never been surpassed for its wide learning and comprehensive treatment of the subject. The third edition of the work, published in 1875, was substantially revised and enlarged in 1901, with much new material on the laces of Italy, England, Ireland, Crete, and Sicily. Nearly 100 new illustrations were added to show different fashions of wearing lace. This fourth edition, published in the United States in 1911, is reprinted here complete and unabridged.<br>Combining meticulous research with a concise, readable style, Mrs. Palliser traces the history and development of lace-making in Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Flanders, France, England, Scotland, Ireland, and other lands. Quoting extensively from the literature of the day, the author outlines the evolution of <i>reticella,</i> a Venetian lace based on geometric forms; the light and flowery <i>point de France</i>; <i>Valenciennes,</i> a fine diamond-meshed lace much used for trimming and ruffles, <i>Chantilly,</i> a delicate mesh with ornate patterns; <i>point d'Espagne,</i> made with gold and silver threads; and many other varieties. In addition to detailing the development of the lace itself, Mrs. Palliser acquaints us with the social, cultural, and economic conditions that affected its manufacture.<br>Over 90 photographs and 173 prints and line drawings depict dozens of different laces and their use in collars, ruffs, handkerchiefs, aprons, fans, mantillas, petticoats, masks, mantles, and ecclesiastical garments. Many of the illustrations have been enlarged to show details of stitching. <i>History of Lace</i> is a book that belongs in the library of every needleworker as well as among the reference books of costume and cultural historians. It is a comprehensive, anecdotal, and profusely illustrated chronicle of an age-old art that has adorned and embellished the clothing and accoutrements of mankind since earliest times. <br><br></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Under the Vale and Other Tales of Valdemar (Valdemar Anthologies)</h2><p>In March 1987, a young author from Oklahoma published her first novel, <i>Arrows of the Queen</i>.

The authors illuminate the importance of live performance in a virtual world, of preserving the ancient art form of storytelling by becoming the story. Theologically, theatre reflects Christianity's central doctrines--incarnation, community, and presence--enhancing the human creative experience and simultaneously engaging viewers on multiple levels.<br><br>This Engaging Culture series title will be a key volume for those interested in theatre as well as drama practitioners, worship leaders, and culture makers.</p><p>"Johnson and Savidge have given Christians a unique gift with <i>Performing the Sacred</i>.

If you don&#x2019;t recognize that name, you&#x2019;re not alone. Crowley is one of nearly 30 American cartoonists featured in this eclectic anthology, artists whose work&#x2015;created between 1900 and 1969&#x2015;was overshadowed by more successful contemporaries. <i>Art Out of Time</i> at last gives these pioneers the showcase they deserve, reprinting&#x2015;in most cases for the first time since their initial publication&#x2015;complete comic books and strips by such visionaries as Raymond Ewer, Howard Nostrand, Ogden Whitney, and Dick Briefer. These under-recognized artists often deviated from the thematic and graphic conventions of the comics medium&#x2015;and influenced Crumb, Art Spiegelman, and others&#x2015;making this superb anthology a true &#x201c;counter history,&#x201d; the untold story of an underground that wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p><b>Dan Nadel </b>is the author of <i>Art Out of Time</i> and the editor of several books, including <i>Gary Panter</i> and <i>The Wilco Book</i>. He is the owner of PictureBox, Inc., a Grammy Award &#x2013;winning packaging and publishing company with more than fifty titles in print, and the co-editor of the Eisner-nominated magazine <i>Comics Comics</i>. His essays and criticism have appeared in many publications, including the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Bookforum</i>, and <i>Eye</i>. As a curator, Nadel has mounted exhibitions for Portugal Arte 10 in Lisbon, the Athens 2007 Biennale in Greece, and numerous other venues in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Paris. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.<br><i>Starred Review.</i> There are lots of anthologies of the work of the past century's famous cartoonists, but Nadel has done a real service in putting together this collection of 29 marvelous nearly unknown comic strip and comic book artists. Many are reprinted from yellowing newsprint&#x2014;in a few cases, like Walter Quermann's late-'30s newspaper strip Hickory Hollow Folks, from the only copies of their work still extant. Only a few, like Ogden Whitney's poker-faced '60s comic book <i>Herbie</i>, have ever been reprinted before. Nadel's five categories, "Exercises in Exploration," "Slapstick," "Acts of Drawing," "Words in Pictures" and "Form and Style," sometimes seem arbitrary; the biographical notes at the back are informative but all too brief. Still, it's hard to argue with the comics themselves. Charles Forbell's 1913 newspaper strip Naughty Pete looks like it had a huge influence on Chris Ware; Gustave Verbeek's bonkers formal experiment The Upside-Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo, from 1904, is still hilarious and sui generis; Rory Hayes's crude but meticulous horror stories from 1969's <i>Bogeyman Comics</i>, the most recent pieces here, were decades ahead of their time. Contemporary cartoonists&#x2014;and their fans&#x2014;have a lot to learn from the freewheeling, witty, try-anything-twice artistic attitude of the pieces Nadel's assembled. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Present at the creation of the slam in early-&#x2019;80s Chicago and included in seminal films and anthologies, Smith (Big Towns, Big Talk, 1992) receded from the scene in recent years after her career as a newspaper journalist ended in scandal. This National Poetry Series winning volume marks a triumphal return, showing an energetic writer with four urgent subjects. She depicts endangered children. She celebrates sex and sexuality, from the public display of celebrities to the power of the female orgasm: Don&#x2019;t hate me because I&#x2019;m multiple.&#x2019; She considers the heritage of black American art, in musical performance and in writing. Finally, she describes the experience of performance itself, with all its pride and embarrassment: Angry, jubilant, weeping poets we are all/ saviors, reluctant hosannas in the limelight.&#x2019; Several poems also animate the troubled lives of famous blues singers; elsewhere, a mother considers how her incarcerated son became a jailhouse scribe.&#x2019; A superb variety of lines and forms short and long, hesitant and rapid-fire gives the book additional depth.

A poet and Buddhist priest, he left the constrictions of temple life behind and at the age of 49 traveled to Kyoto, where he began to make his living by selling tea on the streets and at scenic places around the city. Yet Baisao dispensed much more than tea: though he would never purport to be a Zen master, his clientele, which consisted of influential artists, poets, and thinkers, considered a trip to his shop as having religious importance. His large bamboo wicker baskets provided Baisao and his customers with an occasion for conversation and poetry, as well as exceptional tea.<br>The poems, memoirs, and letters collected here trace his spiritual and physical journey over a long life. This book includes virtually all of his writings translated for the first time into English, together with the first biography of Baisao to appear in any language. It is bound to establish Baisao&#x2019;s place alongside other Zen-inspired poets such as Basho and Ryokan.</p><p>Norman Waddell has brought us an important Japanese Zen poet who has been too long neglected.

The second part of the book surveys the presence of ithyphallic gods in archaic shamanistic religions (the Lord of the Animals), the Greek pantheon (Hermes, Priapus), and the Hindu deities (Ardhanarishvara, the androgyne). Danielou also explores the role of Shaivist and Dionysian initiatory rites in bringing men into communion with the creative forces of life. Illustrated throughout with photographs and line drawings of European and Indian art, <i>The Phallus</i> celebrates the expression of the masculine in the religious traditions of East and West. <br><br>Phallic imagery, in one form or another, may be found in the artistic traditions of virtually every world culture since prehistoric times. Alain Danielou here unveils the religious impulse underlying art that at first glance seems to have no purpose beyond the erotic.</p><p>Alain Dani�lou (1907-1994) wrote more than thirty books about the philosophy, religion, history, and arts of India and the Mediterranean. Following a series of successful careers as a dancer, musician, and composer (Cocteau, Diaghilev, and Stravinsky were among his friends), Dani�lou settled in India and spent fifteen years there in the study of Sanskrit, philosophy, and music. After numerous university appointments in India, he returned in 1963 to Europe, where he established the Institute of Comparative Music Studies. Dani�lou's other books include <i>The Complete Kama Sutra</i>; <i>Gods of Love and Ecstasy</i>;<i> Myths and Gods of India</i>;<i> and Virtue, Success, Pleasure, and Liberation</i>.SEXUALITY / ART <br> <br>Worship of the phallus as a symbol of creative energy has been central to virtually every world culture, and strong traditions of phallic art exist throughout India, Egypt, Greece, and Northern Europe. Yet we in the West, hampered by modern taboos, have been unable to see this most fundamental of symbols for what it is--the image of the creator in mankind. Alain Dani�lou, the foremost authority on the art and spirituality of India and the classical world, here unveils the religious impulse underlying art that at first seems purely erotic. <br> <br><em>The Phallus</em> surveys a wide range of art, myth, and cultural customs, examining phallic amulets of Neolithic man, standing stones of Europe, the mukha lingam of India, the obelisks of Rome and Egypt, and other representations of male fertility. Dani�lou shows the primal role played by ithy-phallic gods in such diverse mythologies as those of the Celts (Cernunnos, the Horned God), Greeks (Pan, Hermes, Priapus), and Hindus (Ardhanarishvara, the androgyne). He also explores the cults of Shiva and Dionysus in their role of bringing men into the communion with the creative forces of life. It is in this capacity--as a manifestation of the creator, a source of bliss and transcendence--that the phallus has its most powerful role in human symbolism. And, Dani�lou argues, if we are to maintain our link to the divine, it must assume this symbolic role again. <br> <br>Profusely illustrated with some of the world's finest examples of phallic art, <em>The Phallus</em> celebrates the expression of the masculine in the religious traditions of East and West. <br> <br>Dancer, musician, and scholar, ALAIN DANI�LOU (1907-1994) wrote more than thirty books about the philosophy, religion, and art of India and the Mediterranean.

It quickly became a benchmark for modernity in the twentieth century--though its durability in the twenty-first may now be in doubt.<br><br>More than a hundred years after the publication of Freud&#x2019;s <b>The Interpretation of Dreams</b>, we&#x2019;re no longer in thrall, says cultural historian Eli Zaretsky, to the &#x201c;romance&#x201d; of psychotherapy and the authority of the analyst. Only now do we have enough perspective to assess the successes and shortcomings of psychoanalysis, from its late-Victorian Era beginnings to today&#x2019;s age of psychopharmacology. In <b>Secrets of the Soul</b>, Zaretsky charts the divergent schools in the psychoanalytic community and how they evolved&#x2013;sometimes under pressure&#x2013;from sexism to feminism, from homophobia to acceptance of diversity, from social control to personal emancipation. From Freud to Zoloft, Zaretsky tells the story of what may be the most intimate science of all.</p><p>Eli Zaretsky was born in Brooklyn, New York. He received his B.A. from the University of Michigan and his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland. His book, <b>Capitalism, the Family and Personal Life</b>, has been translated into fourteen languages. His articles on the history of the family, psychoanalysis, and modern cultural history have appeared in numerous scholarly journals. He is currently Professor of History at the Graduate Faculty at the New School for Social Research, New School University in New York City.Chapter One<br>THE PERSONAL UNCONSCIOUS<br><br>In the modern West there have been two episodes of genuine, widespread introspection: Calvinism and Freudianism. In both cases the turn inward accompanied a great social revolution: the rise of capitalism in the first, and its transformation into an engine of mass consumption in the second. In both cases, too, the results were ironic. Calvinism urged people to look inside themselves to determine whether they had been saved, but it wound up contributing to a new discipline of work, savings, and family life. Freudian introspection aimed to foster the individual's capacity to live an authentically personal life, yet it wound up helping to consolidate consumer society. In both cases, finally, the turn toward self-examination generated a new language. In the case of Calvinism, the language centered on the Protestant idea of the soul, an idea that helped shape such later concepts as character, integrity, and autonomy. The new Freudian lexicon, by contrast, centered on the idea of the unconscious, the distinctive analytic contribution to twentieth-century personal life.<br><br>Of course, the idea of the unconscious was well known before Freud published The Interpretation of Dreams in 1899. Medieval alchemists, German idealist philosophers, and romantic poets had all taught that the ultimate reality was unconscious. The philosopher Schopenhauer, a profound influence on Freud's teacher, Theodor Meynert, maintained that human beings were the playthings of a blind, anonymous will. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the idea of the subconscious was especially widespread. Often termed a "secondary self," larger than the mere ego and accessible through hypnosis or meditation, the subconscious implied the ability to transcend everyday reality. Whether as cosmic force, impersonal will, or subconscious, the unconscious was understood, before Freud, to be anonymous and transpersonal. Frequently likened to the ocean, it aimed to leave the "petty" concerns of the ego behind.<br><br>Freud, too, thought of the unconscious as impersonal, anonymous, and radically other to the individual. But harbored within it, generally close to consciousness, he discerned something new: an internal, idiosyncratic source of motivations peculiar to the individual. In his conception, contingent circumstances, especially in childhood, forged links between desires and impulses, on the one hand, and experiences and memories on the other. The result was a personal unconscious, unique, idiosyncratic, and contingent. For Freud, moreover, there was no escaping into a "larger" or transpersonal reality. The goal, rather, was to understand and accept one's own idiosyncratic nature, a task that, in principle, could never be completed. While Freud went on to posit universal mental patterns, such as the supposed stages of sexual development (oral, anal, genital) and the Oedipus complex, his focus remained the concrete and particular ways that individuals lived out these patterns.<br><br>As Schorske suggested, Freud formulated the concept of the personal unconscious in response to a crisis in the nineteenth-century liberal worldview. This crisis began with industrialization. Associated with the early factory system, the first industrial revolution seemed to reduce individuals to mere cogs in a cruel and irresistible machine. The Victorians erected the famous "haven in a heartless world"-the nineteenth-century middle-class family-against what they viewed as "the petty spite and brutal tyranny" of the workplace. Heavily gendered, the Victorian worldview was in one sense proto-Freudian: it located the "true self" in a private or familial context.1 Nonetheless, it viewed that context as a counterpart to, or compensation for, the economy-not as a discrete and genuinely personal sphere. The latter understanding emerged only with the crumbling of the Victorian family ideal during the second industrial revolution, amid the beginnings of mass production and mass consumption in the 1890s.<br><br>To be sure, mass production deepened the crisis in the liberal worldview, for example, by introducing the assembly line. But it also revealed the emancipatory potential of capitalism in mass culture, leisure, and personal life. By the mid-nineteenth century, cultural modernity, foretold by Baudelaire in Paris, Whitman in Brooklyn, and Dostoyevsky in St. Petersburg, had already weakened Victorianism's separate-spheres ideology and fostered an interest in hysteria, decadence, artistic modernism, the "new woman," and the homosexual. Fin de si�cle culture exacerbated the crisis. As women entered public life, there emerged polyglot urban spaces and new forms of sensationalist, mass entertainment, such as amusement parks, dance halls, and film. The result was a conflict over the heritage of the Enlightenment. Suddenly, the liberal conception of the human subject seemed problematic to many, as did its highest value: individual autonomy.<br><br>For the Enlightenment, autonomy meant the ability to rise above the "merely" private, sensory, and passive or receptive propensities of the mind in order to reach universally valid rational conclusions. Convinced that fin de si�cle culture undermined this ability, many observers lamented the new forces of "degeneration," "narcissism," and "decadence." Freud's fellow Viennese Otto Weininger, for example, warned of the threat to autonomy from what he called the "W" factor-passivity or dependency-which tended to be concentrated in women, homosexuals, and Jews. Thus, he joined an extensive chorus calling for a return to self-control, linked to hard work, abstinence, and savings. At the same time, the beginnings of mass consumption also gave rise to a party of "release." Especially among the middle classes, many people found that the conscious effort they had devoted to working hard and saving only made them (in William James's words) "twofold more the children of hell." Contending that modernity required "an anti-moralistic method," James and others commended "mind cure" and hypnosis as methods that allowed individuals to relax their efforts at self-control.2<br><br>It was in the context of this division that Freud developed his idea of the personal unconscious. In particular, he was responding to the alternation between "control" and "release" that characterized late-nineteenth-century psychiatry. On one side, the tradition of psychiatry that descended from the Enlightenment sought to restore control by strengthening the will and ordering the reasoning processes of "disordered" individuals. On the other side, a later generation of "dynamic" psychiatrists and neurologists sought to facilitate "release" through hypnotism and meditation. Freud's idea of the personal unconscious represented an alternative to both positions. Treating neither self-control nor release per se as a primary value, it encouraged a new, nonjudgmental or "analytic" attitude toward the self. The result was a major modification of the Enlightenment idea of the human subject. No longer the locus of universal reason and morality, the modern individual would henceforth be a contingent, idiosyncratic, and unique person, one whose highly charged and dynamic interiority would be the object of psychoanalytic thought and practice.<br><br>To appreciate Freud's innovation, we need to look briefly at the psychologies that preceded it. From the start, bourgeois society had generated a fresh emphasis on individual psychology. Earlier societies were premised on the model of a great chain of being: the important question was the individual's place in an objective hierarchy. With the rise of capitalism, however, lineage systems receded and ascribed identities ebbed. Increasingly, the important question became not where one stood but who one was. With the Enlightenment and the democratic revolutions that accompanied it, the conception of the human subject moved to the center of every pursuit, including government, education, and social reform.<br><br>Nevertheless, the Enlightenment idea of the subject had little to do with individuality in the twentieth-century sense of that word. Rather, it was linked to the Enlightenment project of a planned, orderly world, a world made up of rational individuals. The key discovery of the Enlightenment was that the manacles that enslaved humanity were, as William Blake wrote, "mind-forged." Progress was not simply a matter of facing up to external obstacles such as despots, priests, and outmoded institutions; it required overcoming internal obstacles as well. If a rational world was to be achieved, the ordering of the individual's internal or mental world would be necessary.<br><br>The Enlightenment psychology that described how rational order could prevail was associationism. Derived from John Locke's thought, and closely connected to the seventeenth-century revolution in physics, associationism assumed that the mind was composed of sensations or representations arising in the external environment and "associated" according to whether they were similar to one another, or whether they had entered the mind at the same time. In Britain, France, and the United States, associationism animated the entire Enlightenment project. For one thing, it explained the importance of infancy: in the early years the brain was soft, "almost liquid," so that tracks set down could last a lifetime.3 Associationism also inspired the building of schools, prisons, and asylums. Modeled on the "well-run family," these new institutions manipulated architecture, schedules, and work regimes to reorder the mental associations of the students, criminals, and lunatics housed within them. Even professions that were aimed at everyday life, such as city building and public health, were based on associationist principles. So pervasive was its influence that one philosophe called associationism "the center whence the thinker goes outward to the circumference of human knowledge."4<br><br>Modern psychiatry, of which psychoanalysis was once a part, was born out of Enlightenment associationism. Initially termed "moral" or psychological treatment, it was premised on the idea that reason was universal and therefore only a part of the mad person's mind was inaccessible. Accordingly, the advocates of moral treatment sought to reach the accessible part. Rejecting the isolation of the insane and the use of coercive techniques such as swaddling and chains, they championed psychological or "moral" methods, aimed at restoring the individual to his reason. Not surprisingly, the founders of modern psychiatry were all participants in the democratic revolutions. Thus, Philippe Pinel, the founder of French psychiatry, helped strike the chains off the mentally ill during the French Revolution, and Benjamin Rush, the founder of American psychiatry, signed the Declaration of Independence.5<br><br>The psychiatrists of the Enlightenment aimed to cure "folly" or madness, by which they meant a disruption in the reasoning process. Accordingly, they described the goal of psychiatry as the reordering of associations. At first they experimented with external regimes or asylums in the hope that an inner order would come to mimic an external one. Soon, however, they began to realize that there was more to the dynamics of control than could be accounted for by treating control as a function of an ordering environment. The great discovery made by nineteenth-century psychiatrists, one that began to undermine moral treatment, was that authority was personal-the primary instrument available to induce order in the disturbed individual's mind was the doctor's own person.6 Thus, Benjamin Rush gave a series of rules to the physician entering the chamber of the "deranged": "catch his EYE, and look him out of countenance . . . there are keys in the eye . . . A second means of securing . . . obedience . . . should be by his VOICE [Next,] the COUNTENANCE . . . should be accommodated to the state of the patient's mind and conduct."7<br><br>In spite of their discovery of the psychological character of authority, Enlightenment psychiatrists had no concept of the unconscious as a sphere of idiosyncratic individuality. Their single goal was to restore the individual to the "normal" reasoning processes common to all members of the human community. In the first half of the nineteenth century, however, two new developments began to transform Enlightenment associationism: romanticism and the "somatic model," or the emphasis on heredity. Both stressed the idea, lacking in associationism, that the mind itself was a shaping force and not merely a record of environmental influences.<br><br>The romantic idea of the imagination was the precursor to the late-nineteenth-century idea of the subconscious. It entered psychology as a kind of reproach or supplement to associationism, as the romantics despised Locke's "passive" conception of the mind. Drawing on the German tradition of Naturphilosophie, according to which the entire universe was a unitary, living organism, and on German idealism generally, romantics defined the imagination as an internal storehouse of images and creative drives. The artist, they insisted, was a "lamp" rather than a "mirror," an original source of values rather than a mere recorder of events.8 With the romantic critique of associationism, Enlightenment psychology deepened. Still, the romantics viewed the imagination as transcendental and impersonal; likening it to the ocean or the sky, they considered it to be all that was not-self.<br><br>The romantic influence entered psychiatry especially through the discovery of "magnetism" (hypnotism) in 1775 and the rapid development of a popular tradition of magnetic healers. By appealing to what became known as the subconscious, these healers broke with associationism. Whereas associationism had been oriented toward the manipulation of ideas, magnetism was transmitted through feeling. Puysegur, an early systematizer of magnetic theory, advised that when the patient awakened from a trance, "one's first question must be: How do you feel? Then: Do you feel that I am doing you good?" In addition, the magnetists stressed the importance of the "rapport" between the specific magnetist and his patient.9 Finally, magnetism made explicit the gendered overtones of self-control. During somnambulism, wrote E. T. A. Hoffman, the German romantic novelist, "the magnetized (the passive feminine part) is in sympathy with the magnetizer (the active masculine part)."10<br><br>The second development that transformed moral treatment was a new "somatic" model of the impact of heredity on the mind. Even before the publication of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859, most psychiatrists had concluded that heredity shaped the brain, which in turn shaped the mind. Just as magnetism was the point of entry for romantic ideas, so Franz-Joseph Gall's phrenology, influential from the 1820s through the 1850s, was the point of entry for biology. Maintaining that the brain was divided into regions, each of which corresponded to a particular mental faculty such as intelligence or "amativity," phrenologists initiated the attempt to ground psychology in a theory of the biological organism. Soon attention turned to the dissection of the brain and the nervous system. By Freud's time the somatic model, in which lesions in the nervous system explained hysteria and other "neuroses," was the dominant theory among psychiatrists.<br><br>For all the impact of romanticism and phrenology, midcentury psychiatry retained the original Enlightenment goal of moral treatment: to adapt the individual to the universal laws governing the association of ideas. The particular qualities of an individual psyche were of little interest to psychiatrists, who followed Enlightenment precedent in valuing the universal over the particular, the rational over the emotional, the communa...</p><h2>Pick Up Your Cross and Follow Me: Volume I of the N.E.M.

Anyone who has read more than a few books on Tibetan Buddhism will have encountered references to the Six Yogas of Naropa, a preeminent yogic technology system. The six practices&#x2014;inner heat, illusory body, clear light, consciousness transference, forceful projection, and bardo yoga&#x2014;gradually came to pervade thousands of monasteries, nunneries, and hermitages throughout Central Asia over the past five and a half centuries.</p><p>Anyone who has read more than a few books on Tibetan Buddhism will have encountered a reference to the Naro Choe Druk (Tib. na ro'i chos drug), a phrase that renders literally as "Naro's Six Dharmas," but is more often encountered in English translation as "the Six Yogas of Naropa." These six-inner heat, illusory body, clear light, consciousness transference, forceful projection, and the bardo yoga-represent one of the most popular Tibetan Buddhist presentations of yogic technology to come from India to the Land of Snows. The Tibetan word choe (Tib. chos) in the expression Naro Choe Druk is a translation"'of the Sanskrit term dharma, which means" doctrine," "teaching," "instruction" or "yogic training." Druk means" six." Thus the system can be called Six Dharmas, Six Doctrines, or Six Yogas. I generally use "the Six Yogas of Naropa," or simply "the Six Yogas," because these are the forms best known to Western readers. Occasionally I resort to the more literal "Naro's Six Dharmas," although whenever I do so I enclose the phrase in quotation marks in order to indicate that I am honoring the Tibetan form of the name, Naro Choe Druk. Tibetan literature randomly refers to the illustrious Indian Buddhist master after whom this tradition is named as Naro, Naropa, and Naropada (born 1016). Naropa was a disciple of the Indian mahasiddha Tilopa (b. 988). The lineages that Naropa gave to his Tibetan lay-disciple Marpa Lotsawa (lit. "Marpa Translator"; b. 1012), especially that of the Six Yo gas, came to pervade thousands of monasteries and hermitages throughout Central Asia, regardless of sect. This is certainly true within all the Sarmai Choeluk, or "New Schools, such as the Kadampa, Kargyupa, Sakyapa, Jonangpa and Gelukpa. In addition, the Six Yogas have also gradually become absorbed into most the Nyingma Choeluk, or "Older Schools." The treatise on the system written by Tsongkhapa the Great (1357-1419)-A Book of Three Inspirations: A Treatise on the Stages of Training in the Profound Path of Naro's Six Dharmas &#x2013; is regarded as one of the finest on the subject to come out of the Land of Snows. Lama Tsongkhapa was the forefather of the Gelukpa school (Tib. dGe 'lugs; lit.. "Order of Excellence"), which quickly swept across Centrall Asia and became the largest single school of tantric Buddhism. He was also the guru of the First Dalai Lama (b. 1391). His treatise has served as the fundamental guide to the system of the Six Yogas of Naropa as practiced in the more than three thousand Gelukpa monasteries, nunneries and hermitages across Central Asia over the past five-and-a half centuries. The Gelukpa lineage came down over the generations to the present day. The principal transmission holder, when I arrived in India in 1972, was Kyabjey Trijang Rinpochey, the Junior Tutor of His Holiness the DalaiLama. He in turn passed it to numerous disciples. I was in Dharamsala in 1973 when Kyabjey Rinpochey delivered his last transmission on Naropa's Six Yogas. At the time I was studying Tibetan language, philosophy and meditation at the Buddhist Studies Program initiated by H. H. the Dalai Lama as part of the activities of his recently established Library of Tibetan Works and Archives in Dharamsala. A few months into the program it was announced that the Junior Tutor to His Holiness, the very venerable and very elderly Kyabjey Trijang Rinpochey, would be giving a teaching in the museum room, the largest space in the building. The subject would be the Six Yogas of Naropa, and the recipients would be a large group of Tibetan yogis, hermits, monks and nuns. We Westerners couldn't attend, but if we liked we could sit in an adjoining room and listen through the sound system. The Dalai Lama's Junior Tutor was considered to be one of the greatest living masters to come out of Tibet, and was regarded as a living buddha by the Tibetan community. News of his discourse had travelled throughout the refugee communities of India and Nepal and great lamas began to roll into town from all directions. One monk who was pointed out to me was said to have spent more than forty years in meditation in the mountains. There were dozens of others with twenty or more years of solitary retreat under their belts. <p>Rinpochey spoke six hours a day for many, many days, using the text of Lama Tsongkhapa as his focus. One day one of the yogis coming out of the room at the end of the session looked at me and said, "Really what a Buddha he is!" When this great lama passed away a few years later, the Tibetan spiritual community mourned.the loss of one of the last of the super-greats to come out of Tibet. When I think back twenty-two years ago to the faces in the front couple of rows at that teaching, many of them have today come to rank among the foremost lamas in the Gelukpa school.</p>Je Tsong-kha-pa (1357&#x2013;1419), founder of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, was one of Tibet's greatest philosophers and a prolific writer.

This edition, illustrated by the author, contains all the verse and stories of The Book of Nonsense, More Nonsense, Nonsense Songs, Nonsense Stories and Nonsense Alphabets and Nonsense Cookery. It has a biographical Preface by Lear himself, and concludes with some delightful &#39;heraldic&#39; sketches of his cat, Foss.</p><p>"He reads but he cannot speak Spanish, / He cannot abide ginger-beer; / Ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish, / How pleasant to know Mr. Lear!" writes the 19th-century English poet Edward Lear in "Self Portrait of the Laureate of Nonsense." When <i>The Book of Nonsense</i> was first published in 1845, under Lear's pseudonym, Derry Down Derry, it was a success--some say it turned the once stodgy, didactic world of children's literature on its head. <p> This rollicking poetic romp begins with "A Book of Nonsense" (1846), a slew of more-odd-than-bawdy limericks about the Young Lady of Wales, the Old Man of Vienna, and many, many more, all accompanied by the spare, whimsical ink drawings done by Lear himself. Part two urges readers to leap into "Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany and Alphabets" (1871), including the classic "The Owl and the Pussy-cat" and "The Jumblies" (who "went to sea in a Sieve"), along with equally rib-tickling but lesser known selections such as "The Nutcrackers and the Sugar-Tongs." In this section, you'll also discover instructions for how to make Crumbobblious Cutlets, a "Nonsense Botany" guide featuring the <i>Bottlephorkia spoonifolia</i> and the <i>Manypeeplia upsidownia</i>, and "Nonsense Alphabets," strange little poems about quills, rattlesnakes, screws, and other words beginning with letters. </p><p> Part three merrily inflicts "More Nonsense Pictures, Rhymes, Botany, &amp;c." (1877) on readers with the well-known plant <i>Washtubbia circularis</i> and more wacky limericks such as "There was an old person of Bar, / Who passed all her life in a jar, / Which she painted pea-green, to appear more serene, / That placid old person of Bar." As icing on a very strange cake, the last section offers "Laughable Lyrics, A Fourth Book of Nonsense Poems, Songs, Botany, Music, &amp;c." (1877), notably including "The Pobble Who Has No Toes." Lear's quirky sense of humor infuses every line of his ever skillful verse, which is often alliterative, and always very silly. Lear, the Laureate of Nonsense, frolics frivolously, and no one should ever go to sea in a Sieve without a copy of this book in tow.

He's got a friend--that's right, just one--at his fancy prep school, and a pretty cool dad (even if he is obsessed with organic soaps that smell like a mix of salted pork and Icelandic bog). The problem is, Greg isn't ordinary . . . he's actually an honest-to-goodness, fantastical Dwarf! <br><br>He discovers the truth the day his dad brings home a gross new tea--one that awakens bizarre abilities in Greg.

A few examples:<br><br> � Great-Aunt Millie&#x2019;s legendary beard caught fire on a Thursday. Once the flawless envy of every Belmont (man or woman), it sadly never quite grew back the same again.<br><br> � Second Midwestern Bank repossessed the old Belmont family farm on a Thursday way back in 1929, dooming the family henceforth to dreary city life. Ever since, all my aunts and uncles call it a slimy <i>Pointer </i>bank. Nobody will tell me what that means, but it&#x2019;s almost certainly a curse word since it&#x2019;s precisely what Aunt Millie screamed the moment she realized her beard was on fire.<br><br> � My cousin Phin lost his brand-new car on a Thursday. To this day we have no idea where it went. He parked it on a street in the city, but then simply forgot where. After looking for over an hour, he gave up and took the bus home. If you say it&#x2019;s impossible to just lose a midsize sedan, I&#x2019;ll show you a Belmont on a Thursday.<br> &nbsp;<br> There are so many more, but the point is: I shouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised to nearly get torn limb from limb on a Thursday. I certainly expected <i>something </i>bad to happen, since it nearly always did. Just not something so drastic. I thought maybe I&#x2019;d get gum stuck in my hair. Or perhaps Perry would try to stuff me into the toilet in the fourth stall of the boys&#x2019; locker room again&#x2014;which was actually <i>almost </i>as bad as getting attacked by a monster since this particular toilet was so notorious it even had its own name: the Souper Bowl. The Souper Bowl hadn&#x2019;t been flushed since 1954 due to some superstitious school tradition that ran so deep even the city&#x2019;s top health inspector (a former student) overlooked it. I can&#x2019;t even describe to you the horrible sights I&#x2019;ve seen inside that stall&#x2014;and the smell shall never be mentioned again.<br><br> But I&#x2019;m certainly not complaining about Thursdays. They&#x2019;re just part of being a Belmont. Some kids are born rich, some are born poor; some are born with eight toes, some are born with blond hair; and others just happen to have been born with a Thursday curse.<br><br> Luckily, my whole family was pretty good at coping with it. We even had a saying: <i>Thursdays are why every other day seems so great! </i>Okay, so maybe it&#x2019;s not very catchy, but it worked. The other days of the week truly felt like a holiday compared to Thursdays.<br><br> That particular Thursday started out simply enough: with a supposedly harmless school field trip to the Lincoln Park Zoo.<br><br> The Isaacson Preparatory Empowerment Establishment (I dare you to try saying you go to a school called I-PEE with a straight face) is one of the fanciest and most prestigious private schools in the country. They had enough money to <i>buy </i>their own zoo if they wanted. But instead they sent us on &#x201c;cultural enrichment&#x201d; trips once a month to places like the Shedd Aquarium, or a local apple orchard, or another, much poorer school on the west side so my classmates could see firsthand just how much better their lives were than other kids&#x2019;.<br><br> That Thursday, a convoy of luxury charter buses drove the entire school up Lake Shore Drive toward the zoo. Lake Michigan flanked us on the right, looking like an ocean with a sparkling blue surface that stretched on forever.<br><br> My first goal, after stepping off the bus at the entrance to the Lincoln Park Zoo, was to find Edwin.<br> That was the good part about Field Trip Thursdays: getting to hang out with my best friend all day.<br><br> Edwin was easily the most popular kid at the PEE, and perhaps also the richest. And maybe that&#x2019;s not a coincidence?<br><br> Not that being wealthy was rare for the PEE&#x2019;s students (I was one of the few exceptions). Of the school&#x2019;s 440 students, only 45 of us paid reduced tuition. The rest came from families wealthy enough to afford $43,000 a year for something they could have gotten for free.<br><br> But Edwin&#x2019;s family was like a whole other level (or two, or forty) of being completely loaded. I spent my summers working at my dad&#x2019;s organic health goods store, whereas Edwin spent his summers jetting all across the world on his parents&#x2019; fleet of private luxury planes. Yeah, that&#x2019;s plane<i>s</i>&#x2014;as in they owned more than one private jet. I didn&#x2019;t even know what exactly Edwin&#x2019;s parents did for a living. They worked downtown doing something vague and financey&#x2014;like CEO of a Money Management Investment Firm, or Executive Commodities Director, or Market Analyst Portfolio Broker Financial President Administrator.<br><br> But the point is: despite us coming from two different worlds, Edwin and I had been best friends from the moment we met three years ago.<br><br> I found him in the crowd that Thursday surrounded by a flock of pretty eighth-grade girls. They collectively made a face as I joined the group. I assumed it was partly because I smelled like a mixture of salted pork shank and Icelandic bog (yeah, so my dad made his own organic soaps and forced me to use them). Either way, I ignored the girls&#x2019; annoyed stares as they dispersed&#x2014;like they always did when I showed up.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, Greg,&#x201d; Edwin said with a huge grin. &#x201c;Did your dad find anything cool on his trip? Any extinct Norwegian tree saps? Or a new strain of peat moss? Maybe he finally tracked down the rare and elusive Arconian button mushroom?&#x201d;<br><br> Part of my dad&#x2019;s job as an <i>artisanal craftsman </i>(his words, not mine) involved traveling all over the world in search of new ingredients to use in his soaps and teas and other natural health products.<br><br> He&#x2019;d been in Norway all week on the hunt.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, he gets back tomorrow,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Why? Are you really that anxious to try his newest tea?&#x201d;<br><br> Edwin looked at me like I had asked him to put his finger in my left nostril.<br><br> &#x201c;Uh, not after last time,&#x201d; he said with a laugh. &#x201c;His last batch of tea almost caused my face to explode, remember?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;To be fair, he had no idea you were allergic to shale,&#x201d; I reminded him.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s because shale is rock,&#x201d; Edwin said, grinning. &#x201c;I never ate it before, because, generally speaking, people <i>don&#x2019;t eat rocks</i>.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Hey, you&#x2019;re the one who asked him for a sample. My dad never <i>makes </i>you try anything. <i>I&#x2019;m </i>usually the guinea pig.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know, but I can&#x2019;t help it, I really like your dad,&#x201d; Edwin said. &#x201c;He makes me laugh. Guy is hilarious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad one of us finds him funny,&#x201d; I muttered.<br><br> Deep down I also loved my dad&#x2019;s quirks, but I hated to show it.<br><br> &#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; Edwin said with a cheesy smile, &#x201c;are you ready for the <i>breathtaking </i>world of the Lincoln Park Zoo?&#x201d;<br><br> I rolled my eyes.<br><br> That was the thing about being as rich as Edwin: when you could afford to do literally anything you wanted, most normal things became boring. Just last winter his parents flew him in a helicopter over a Siberian nature reserve in eastern Russia&#x2014; there was no way a trip to the zoo could live up to that. That was probably why he loved my dad so much: one of the few things money couldn&#x2019;t buy you was a kooky, eccentric, and (debatably) hilarious father.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, you never know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Maybe watching depressed animals lay around in a cage is more exciting than it sounds?&#x201d;<br><br> Edwin laughed. He got a kick out of my bizarrely gloomy optimism. I blamed my dad for that trait.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be such a gwint,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> Edwin called me a gwint when he thought I was being too <i>pessimistic</i>. I had no idea what <i>gwint </i>meant, but it&#x2019;d always seemed oddly fitting. Edwin had a knack for making up strangely appropriate nicknames. Like Hot Sauce, for example. He was one of the PEE&#x2019;s English teachers and field trip chaperones. His real name was Mr. Worchestenshire, and of course we all knew that Worcestershire sauce wasn&#x2019;t technically hot sauce, but when Edwin coined the nickname, he didn&#x2019;t know exactly what kind of sauce Worcestershire was. Plus, Hot Sauce was just a way better nickname than Miscellaneous Food Condiment. So it stuck.<br><br> &#x201c;Whatever,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your move, by the way. Or are you stalling, hoping that I will forget what my Master Plan is?&#x201d;<br><br> Edwin scoffed and took out his phone.<br><br> One of the things we realized we had in common right away was chess. Not many kids played chess. In fact, I&#x2019;d only met one other kid who played chess: Danny Ipsento. He used to live down the street from me. Turned out, in addition to playing chess, his other hobbies included starting fires and throwing shoes at pigeons. So we never really became friends&#x2014;I was too unlucky to have a friend with such dangerous hobbies&#x2014;it&#x2019;d be hazardous to my health.<br><br> But the point was: the rarity of chess players made it seem almost too perfect the first time I saw Edwin open the Chess With Friends app on his phone. I only started playing because my dad was obsessed with the game and taught me when I was three. My dad never stopped talking about chess&#x2019;s <i>perfections</i>: how ancient it was, how it was the <i>only </i>game in existence where luck played absolutely no factor, and how you completely controlled your own destiny. Every move, every win, every loss was entirely in your own hands, something that life never offered (especially to Belmonts). Which was also why I grew to love it, despite the fact that I rarely won. Every new game, the possibility of success was limited only by my own actions. Which was immensely comforting for someone from a family cursed with terrible luck.<br><br> I was still nowhere near as good as my dad. Or even Edwin, for that matter. I beat Edwin probably once every ten or fifteen games, and even then I figured he only let me win to keep me interested. He loved chess partially for the same reason as me: he grew up learning. His dad, in addition to being obscenely wealthy, also happened to be a former world chess champion. And Edwin had always idolized his dad, so much that he used to try to emulate his movements so he would one day walk and talk and act just like him. But Edwin also loved chess on an even deeper level, maybe for the same reason he was able to make so many friends: he loved deciphering people&#x2019;s inner thoughts.<br><br>Edwin finally made his move as Hot Sauce, our chaperone, led our group down a concrete path.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, man, I don&#x2019;t even want to know what you&#x2019;re up to,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t have a phone myself (a long story). So I&#x2019;d have to wait to see his move until later when I could get to the computer lab.<br><br> &#x201c;Try not to worry about it too much,&#x201d; Edwin taunted. &#x201c;Just enjoy this spectacular trip that the PEE has arranged for our delights and amusements.&#x201d;<br><br> I laughed.<br><br> We started the tour with the Big Bears Exhibit&#x2014;as if there was any other kind of bear. We entered an area surrounded on three sides by European buckthorn trees (yeah, so I kind of have a thing for trees) and low wooden fences. In front of us, a thick pane of clear viewing glass separated the zoo patrons from this portion of the bear exhibit. It consisted of a sloping stone cliff scattered with rocks. Several massive polar bears lounged on the rocky slope in front of us.<br><br> The other kids oohed and aahed as the giant bear heads turned to stare at us.<br><br> The hairs on my arms stood on end as the largest of all the bears locked eyes with me. He let out a roar so intense we could all hear it through multiple layers of safety glass.<br><br> I&#x2019;d never really been much of an animal person. Other people&#x2019;s pets usually avoided me like I was diseased. Which was embarrassing since dogs had literally evolved over thousands of years to <i>love </i>human beings.<br><br> But as I stood there and stared in shock at the large bear roaring at me inside the Lincoln Park Zoo, this felt entirely different from dogs and cats not liking me. It&#x2019;s hard to explain, but I definitely knew something was off right away. It was clear in that moment that the bear hated <i>me </i>more than anything else in the world.<br><br> Everybody watched in awed silence as the polar bear took a few steps toward us. On two legs, he was easily three times my height. With paws large enough to hack off my whole face in a single swipe.<br><br> The bear&#x2019;s lips parted into another snarl.<br><br> Then he bent over and picked up a boulder with his front paws. The other kids gasped. A few laughed as the bear shuffled closer toward us with the giant rock squeezed between his claws. <br><br>&#x201c;Dude, did that bear really just pick up a boulder?&#x201d; Edwin asked.<br><br> A young employee with a name tag (<i>Lexi</i>) stepped in front of our group of stunned students.<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need to be alarmed,&#x201d; Lexi said with a proud smile. &#x201c;Wilbur and several of the other adult bears <i>love </i>playing with the rocks. They do it all the time. Bears, like dogs and cats, can be surprisingly playful animals.&#x201d;<br><br> Wilbur let out another savage roar.<br><br> Lexi was still smiling, but her eyes flicked nervously back toward the bears. Wilbur took a few more steps forward, the boulder in his grasp. He was now directly on the other side of the viewing glass.<br><br>And still staring right at me.<br><br> The polar bear raised the rock and smashed it into the safety glass.<br><br> THUD.<br><br> The crowd gasped and took a collective step backward as the pane vibrated. But it did not break, or even crack. Lexi&#x2019;s smile was gone, but she was doing her best to reassure us that everything was okay.<br><br> &#x201c;There are five separate panes of reinforced laminated safety glass,&#x201d; she said, her voice shaking. &#x201c;No need to worry.&#x201d;<br><br> Wilbur let out another roar and smashed the rock into the glass again.<br><br> THUD.<br><br> The innermost pane of the glass splintered like a spiderweb. The crowd&#x2019;s nervous murmurs turned into something much closer to panic.<br><br> <i>Bears do not shatter unbreakable safety glass.<br></i><br> I knew that as much as I knew that Goblins did not exist and my dad&#x2019;s soap really did smell terrible&#x2014;they were facts. Yet all I could do was watch in horror as this particular bear, worked into an unearthly rage by my presence, smashed the thick viewing glass yet again with the boulder.<br><br> THUD.<br><br> Shards of glass fell around the bear inside the pen. He&#x2019;d just easily shattered several more layers of the viewing glass. The crowd backed up steadily. Some people were already running away. Any traces of calm that had remained on Lexi&#x2019;s face were gone as she spoke rapidly into a walkie-talkie.<br><br>Wilbur the polar bear reared back with the rock and then thrust it forward a final time.<br><br> CRASH!<br><br> The final two layers of glass shattered, spilling onto the floor in a million little pieces.<br><br> Kids and other zoo patrons screamed as they dove for cover. Wilbur rushed past them as if they weren&#x2019;t even there. He had a very specific target in mind and nothing would get in his way.<br><br> Wilbur the twelve-foot-tall polar bear was charging right toward <i>me</i>.</p><h2>The Killing Game: Selected Writings by the author of Dark Alliance</h2><p>Gary Webb had an inborn journalistic tendency to track down corruption and expose it. For over thirty-four years, he wrote stories about corruption from county, state, and federal levels. He had an almost magnetic effect to these kinds of stories, and it was almost as if the stories found him. It was his gift, and, ultimately, it was his downfall.<br>He was best known for his story Dark Alliance, written for the San Jose Mercury News in 1996. In it Webb linked the CIA to the crack-cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles during the Iran Contra scandal. His only published book, Dark Alliance is still a classic of contemporary journalism. But his life consisted of much more than this one story, and The Killing Game is a collection of his best investigative stories from his beginning at the Kentucky Post to his end at the Sacramento News &amp; Review. It includes Webb's series at the Kentucky Post on organized crime in the coal industry, at the Cleveland Plain Dealer on Ohio State&#x2019;s negligent medical board, and on the US military&#x2019;s funding of first-person shooter video games. The Killing Game is a dedication to his life&#x2019;s work outside of Dark Alliance, and it&#x2019;s an exhibition of investigative journalism in its truest form.</p><p><p>An award-winning investigative reporter, <b>GARY WEBB</b> (1955&#x2013;2004) is best known for his &#x201c;Dark Alliance&#x201d; series that linked a Northern California drug ring with the CIA and the United States&#x2019; burgeoning crack epidemic. When the story first appeared in 1996 on the website of the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i>, it became an unprecedented internet sensation, receiving up to 1.3 million hits daily. The report was the target of a famously vicious media backlash that ended his career as a mainstream journalist. When Webb told the whole story in the book <i>Dark Alliance</i>, some of the same publications that had vilified him retracted their criticism and praised his courage in telling the truth about one of the worst official abuses in our nation&#x2019;s history. Others, including his own former newspaper and the <i>New York Times</i>, continued to treat him as an outlaw. Before joining the <i>Mercury News</i>, Webb cut his journalism teeth at the <i>Kentucky Post</i> and <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i>. He is the co-recipient of an Investigative Reporters and Editors Award (for a story at the Post about links between the Kentucky coal mining industry and organized crime) and a Pulitzer Prize (as part of a team at the <i>Mercury News</i> covering the 1988 San Francisco Earthquake). <i>Dark Alliance</i> won the 1998 Firecracker Alternative Book Award in the Politics category, and was a finalist for the PEN/Newman&#x2019;s Own First Amendment Award. In 2014 Webb&#x2019;s story was adapted into the major motion picture <i>Kill the Messenger</i>. His death in 2004 was ruled a suicide.</p></p><h2>Carving 18th Century American Furniture Elements: 10 Step-By-Step Projects for Furniture Makers</h2><p>Presenting 10 projects--from shaping the surface through layout to rough carving and detailed carving--this guide explains the process of carving authentic motifs found on the most treasured pieces of 18th-century American furniture.

The account, compiled by leading presidential historians of the day, reached back to George Washington&#x2019;s administration and was designed to provide a benchmark against which Nixon&#x2019;s misdeeds could be measured.<br><br>What the report found was that, with the exception of William Henry Harrison (who served less than a month), every American president has been accused of misconduct: James Buchanan was charged with rigging the election of 1856; Ulysses S. Grant was reprimanded for not firing his corrupt staffer, Orville Babcock, in the &#x201c;Whiskey Ring&#x201d; bribery scandal; and Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x2019;s administration faced repeated charges of malfeasance in the Works Progress Administration.<br><br>Now, as another president and his subordinates face an array of charges on a wide range of legal and constitutional offenses, a group of presidential historians has come together under the leadership of James M.

Not long before that, in 2003, Flew and Christian philosopher Gary Habermas debated at a Veritas Forum at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Habermas, perhaps the world&#39;s leading expert on the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus, made the case for rational belief on the basis of the reliability of the evidence. Flew argued for alternative understandings of the evidence presented. For two-and-a-half decades Flew and Habermas have been in friendly dialogue about the plausibility of the resurrection and the existence of God. This book presents the full content of their third and final debate, as well as transcripts of the Q A session with the audience afterward. Also included are a 2004 conversation between Habermas and Flew shortly after Flew&#39;s much-publicized change of position, as well as editor David Baggett&#39;s assessment and analysis of the full history of Habermas and Flew&#39;s interactions. Here is your opportunity to listen in on a conversation with two of the greatest thinkers of our era about one of the most pivotal events in human history. Follow the evidence wherever it leads. And decide for yourself whether it&#39;s believable that a man could rise from the dead.</p><p>&#34;Lay readers could hardly ask for a better entr�e to the resurrection as a philosophical issue. A beacon of enlightenment on its subject.&#34;<strong>Gary R. Habermas</strong> (Ph.D., Michigan State University) is Distinguished Research Professor and chair of the department of philosophy and theology at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. He is the author, coauthor or editor of many books, including <em>The Case for the Resurrection of Jesus, The Risen Jesus Future Hope, The Resurrection: Heart of New Testament Doctrine</em> and <em>The Resurrection: Heart of the Christian Life.</em></p><h2>Inherit the Truth 1939-1945: The Documented Experiences of a Survivor of Auschwitz and Belsen</h2><p>This autobiography relates the author&#39;s experiences, as well as those of her sister Renate, as a prisoner at both Auschwitz and Belsen. It tells how their lives were saved by courage, ingenuity, and several improbable strokes of luck. At Auschwitz, Anita escaped death through her talents as a cellist when she was co-opted onto the camp orchestra. The book contains a number of documents, most of them now lodged in the archives of the Imperial War Museum in London. There is a sequence of letters to her sister Marianne in England, from just before the War to 1942, when her parents were deported and liquidated. The predicament of Anita and Renate inside the concentration camps is conveyed, and the text shows how the sisters&#39; capture while fleeing to Paris turned out to be a stroke of &#34;luck&#34; - they were sent to prison and thus spared the much worse horrors of Auschwitz for a crucial year in the middle of the War. This text featured in BBC Radio 4&#39;s &#34;Desert Island Discs&#34; programme on August 25, 1996, and in addition a BBC TV film was screened in October 1996.</p><p>Anita Lasker-Wallfisch was brought up in Breslau, in Silesia, the daughter of a distinguished lawyer, Alfons Lasker, whose brother Edward became an American chess champion. At the age of thirteen she studied the cello with Leo Rostal in Berlin, until the 1938 Kristallnacht forced her to return home. After surviving the war, she managed to emigrate to England in 1946; and in 1949 she became a founder member of the English Chamber Orchestra, with which she still plays. She married Peter Wallfisch, the pianist, and has two children, Maya and Rafael, who is also a celebrated cellist.Walter Laqueur, Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington, in Holocaust and Genocide Studies: &#39;It is my job...to read most of the current literature on the Holocaust, and if someone had the time and inclination to read only one book published recently, I would...choose without hesitation a small book [Inherit the Truth] which appeared last month in England...it is precisely as a historian that I recommend this account...&#39; Sir Martin Gilbert in his Preface: &#39;Like so much in this book, the story of liberation brings a chill to the spine and the realization of the miracle of survival. Anita Lasker-Wallfisch has given an account which, in its personal immediacy, conveys many elements of the almost unconveyable.&#39; Peter Lennon in the Guardian: &#39;There are the baleful routines of war, which we persuade ourselves we can just about cope with mentally, and then the obscene recesses of war featuring particularly perverse human behaviour which baffles us almost more than it appals. The Ladies&#39; Orchestra, formed of Auschwitz inmates, set up by the Nazis to provide stirring music daily at the extermination camp, is one of those aberrations. When you meet someone who played in that orchestra, greedy curiosity prompts you to ask: &#34;What was it like?&#34; Then you panic in case they might actually be able to convey the experience to you. If anyone could, it would be Anita Lasker-Wallfisch...&#39; In December 2002, the German Ambassador, Thomas Matussek, presented Anita Lasker-Wallfisch with the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, and said this in his address, referring to her plea for understanding and tolerance between Britain and Germany, especially among young people: &#39;You overcame this natural hatred, this natural bitterness. In an extraordinary achievement, you have devoted your life to turning the most terrifying and traumatic personal experience into a universal message. It is a timeless appeal, to which we must listen and remind ourselves of over and over again.&#39; Classical Music: &#39;...a harrowing account of how a sixteen-year-old had survived enormous atrocities...due largely to her ability to play the cello.&#39; Independent on Sunday: &#39;There was never any doubt about the alternative to playing in the orchestra. &#34;I was once asked on Newsnight, &#39;How did you know that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz?&#39; &#34; She gestures to a building ten yards away. &#34;They weren&#39;t exactly hidden. We saw the people going in and coming out as smoke&#34;...&#34;[The book] started with watching a TV documentary in 1985. My son said to me: &#39;Actually, you&#39;ve never told us anything.&#39; I decide to write down something strictly for my children.&#34; This narrative was shared with a wider audience when she was persuaded to give a series of radio talks and in turn led to her book.&#39; Michael Kennedy in Sunday Telegraph: &#39;Books about the Holocaust have a numbing effect. How can anyone who was not there begin to comprehend the unspeakable horror of it all?...What is almost unbelievable is the resilience of the human spirit as exemplified by those who experienced Auschwitz and other camps. Two recent books, one by a victim, the other by a survivor [Anita Lasker-Wallfisch], add valuably to the documentation of a ghastly period in history.&#39; Raphael Wallfisch, interviewed in the Sunday Times: &#39;The first time I noticed the number, 69388, on my mother&#39;s arm, I asked, as any young child would, what it was for. Her answer was that she had once been in prison, but she never invited any further comment...The history came out in bits and pieces...I knew that she played the cello in the Auschwitz orchestra, but never the fine details, until she wrote the book.&#39;</p><h2>National Standards and Best Practices for U.S. Museums</h2><p>For the first time, the U.S. museum profession's current operating standards in areas from public accountability to facilities and risk management are available in a single publication.

So, when a long-time NPR correspondent wanted to learn more about the real China, he started driving a cab--and discovered a country amid seismic political and economic change.</b> <br> China--America's most important competitor--is at a turning point. With economic growth slowing, Chinese people face inequality and uncertainty as their leaders tighten control at home and project power abroad. <br> In this adventurous, original book, NPR correspondent Frank Langfitt describes how he created a free taxi service--offering rides in exchange for illuminating conversation--to go beyond the headlines and get to know a wide range of colorful, compelling characters representative of the new China. They include folks like "Beer," a slippery salesman who tries to sell Langfitt a used car; Rocky, a farm boy turned Shanghai lawyer; and Chen, who runs an underground Christian church and moves his family to America in search of a better, freer life. <br> Blending unforgettable characters, evocative travel writing, and insightful political analysis, <i>The Shanghai Free Taxi</i> is a sharply observed and surprising book that will help readers make sense of the world's other superpower at this extraordinary moment.</p><p><b>Frank Langfitt</b> is NPR's London correspondent, covering Brexit, terrorism and other stories in Western Europe. Before coming to the United Kingdom, he spent a decade as a reporter in China, most recently as NPR's correspondent in Shanghai, where he drove a free taxi around the city for a series on a changing China as seen through the eyes of ordinary people. Langfitt got the idea for the series from his experience decades earlier driving taxis in Philadelphia during summers home from college. The NPR radio series inspired his first book, "The Shanghai Free Taxi: Journeys with the Hustlers and Rebels of the New China." <br> In 2008, Langfitt covered the Beijing Olympics as a member of NPR's team, which won an Edward R. Murrow Award for sports reporting. From 1997 to 2002, he was the Baltimore Sun's Beijing correspondent, covering a swath of Asia from the Khyber Pass to East Timor. Langfitt is a graduate of Princeton and was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard. He lives outside London with his wife, Julie, and their two children.

He'd packed it days ago, blindly filling it with everything he'd thought he might need. There was no mouth guard. Fine. He'd proceed without one.<br><br>He hurried to his companion's motionless form, straddled her waist. Her precious life slipped away with every second that passed. CPR was a last resort, but suddenly her only hope, and because they were locked inside a dungeon, no one else inside their cell, the responsibility belonged to him alone. The guy who'd rarely ever come this close to another person.<br><br><em>Just call me Wonder Doc.</em><br><br>He flattened his gloved hands over Mari's delicate chest&#x2014;<em>still, too still.</em> But rather than proceed as he should have, he found himself pausing to savor the rare and extraordinary connection with the opposite sex. <em>So soft. So luscious.</em><br><br><em>What the hell am I doing?</em> Jaw clenched, he pushed. <em>Crack.</em><br><br>Too hard. He'd just broken her sternum and probably several of her ribs.<br><br>Guilt pierced straight through his heart, and if the organ hadn't already been shredded beyond repair, it might have hurt. Sweat trickled down his temples as he pressed against Mari's chest more gently. Nothing else broke. Good. Okay. He pressed again and again, gradually increasing his speed. But how fast was too fast? What helped? What damaged?<br><br>"Come on, Mari." She was human, but strong. Fragile, but resilient. "Stay with me. You can survive this, I know you can."<br><br>Her head lolled to the side, her glassy eyes staring out at nothing.<br><br>"No. No!" He checked her for a pulse, waited...but never felt even the weakest of beats.<br><br>As he returned his hands to her chest to start over, his gaze locked on her blood-splattered lips; his mind willed them to part, a cough to escape. It would mean the sickness still plagued her, but sick was better than dead any day of the week.<br><br>"Mari, please." He heard the desperation in his voice, didn't care. <em>I can't be the one to kill someone so sweet.</em><br><br>Torin pushed harder, heard another crack.<br><br>Hell. He wasn't some pansy crier, but damn if tears didn't scald the backs of his eyes.<br><br>He'd come to think of this girl as a friend, and despite the numerous centuries he'd lived, he didn't have many of those. He always protected the ones he had.<br><br>Until her.<br><br>If not for him, she never would have sickened in the first place.<br><br>Again he felt for a pulse. Still no beat.<br><br>Cursing, he set back to work. Five minutes...ten...twenty. He was Mari's life support, the only thing standing between her and death; he would do this however long proved necessary.<br><br><em>Pull through, Mari. You have to pull through.</em><br><br>"Fight this!" But as another eternity elapsed without any change in her, he finally admitted his efforts weren't doing any good. She was already gone.<br><br>Already dead.<br><br>And there was nothing he could do to bring her back.<br><br>With a roar, Torin wrenched away and paced the cell like the caged animal he was. His arms shook. His back and thighs ached. But what was physical pain compared to mental? Emotional? This was his fault. He'd known what would happen if ever he touched the girl, and he'd lured her closer anyway.<br><br><em>Monster!</em> With another roar, he punched the wall, enjoying the unrelenting throb of pain as skin split and bones fractured. He punched again and again, cracks appearing in the stone, dust pluming around him.<br><br>If he had just stopped to question why a girl like Mari would be so starved for companionship she would agree to be with <em>him</em> she would still be alive.<br><br>He pressed his forehead against the battered wall. <em>I'm keeper of the demon of Disease. When will I accept the fact that I'm meant to fly solo?</em><br><br><em>To be forever denied what I crave most.</em><br><br>"Mari, darling," a slightly accented voice rang out. Female... <em>delicious</em>&#x2014;even soaked in panic and pain as it was. "The bond is broken. Why is it broken?"<br><br>The blood in Torin's veins turned into fuel, igniting as if a blazing match had just been thrown inside him. He became increasingly aware of his own heartbeat, speeding up, the need to stalk to the cell's door and rip away every metal bar consuming him; anything to erase the distance between him and the speaker.<br><br>An extreme reaction. He knew that. Just as he knew such excruciating awareness of another person was unusual for him. It was also uncontrollable and unstoppable, his entire world centering around this one woman.<br><br>And this wasn't the first time it had happened. Anytime she'd spoken, no matter the words she'd uttered, the huskiness of her tone had always carried a promise of absolute pleasure. As if there were nothing she wanted more than to kiss, lick and suck on him.<br><br>Masculine instincts he'd spent countless years denying shouted, <em>Come, little moth. Come closer to my flame.</em><br><br><em>Or I'll come to you....</em><br><br>He strode to the bars and, like a thousand times before, willed the shadows between their cells to part. But it did no good. Her appearance remained a mystery.<br><br>Somehow his sick obsession with her only intensified...and he thought that, for just five minutes of that kissing, licking and sucking, he would have happily risked a worldwide plague.<br><br><em>Hate myself.</em> Someone should string him up by the collarbone and cane him. Again.<br><br>"Mari!" his obsession said. "Please."<br><br>Disease whipped into a frenzy, banging against To-rin's skull, suddenly desperate to escape.<br><br>Escape <em>her?</em> Another unusual reaction. Usually the demon adored such close proximity with a potential victim.<br><br>How the fiend had laughed at Mari....<br><br><em>Hate him, too.</em><br><br>"Mari can't talk right now," Torin said. <em>Or ever. The admission...likepouring salt over my wounds.</em> Bars rattled. "What did you do to her?" Nothing...everything. "Tell me!" the female shouted.<br><br>"I shook her hand." The words exploded from him, bitter and cutting. "That's it." But he'd done far more than that, hadn't he.<br><br>He'd put a lot of time and effort into charming her. Feeding her. Talking and laughing with her. Eventually she'd felt comfortable enough to remove one of his gloves and intertwine their fingers. On purpose.<br><br><em>Nothing bad will happen,</em> she had said. Or maybe her gaze had said it. The details were hazed by the fog of his eagerness. <em>You'll see.</em><br><br>He'd believed her. Because he'd wanted to believe her more than he'd wanted to take his next breath. He'd held on to her so tightly, a thirsty man who'd just discovered the last glass of water in a world burning to ash, nearly brought to his knees by the force of his physical response. Sensation after sensation had overwhelmed him. Feminine softness so near his masculine hardness. A floral scent in his nose. The ends of her silky hair tickling his wrist. Her warmth blending with his own. Her breath intersecting with his.<br><br><em>I experienced an instant connection, immediate bliss, and very nearly creamed my damn jeans. From a handshake.</em><br><br>She'd died from it.<br><br>With him, it never mattered if the touch was accidental or intentional, or if the victim was human or animal, young or old, male or female...good or evil; any living creature sickened soon after contact with him. Even immortals like himself. Difference was, immortals sometimes survived, becoming carriers of whatever illness they'd contracted from him, capable of spreading it to others. As a human, Mari had never even stood a chance.<br><br>"Tell me the truth," his obsession demanded. "Every detail."<br><br>He didn't know her name or if she was human or immortal. He only knew Mari had made a deal with the devil to save her.<br><br>The two women had been imprisoned here for centuries&#x2014;wherever "here" was&#x2014;for no real crime Torin could perceive. Cronus, the prison's owner, had never really needed a reason to ruin someone's life.<br><br>He'd certainly helped ruin Torin's.<br><br>He had owed Torin a favor, and Torin, being Torin, had chosen to overlook the male's shady reputation and ask for a woman who wouldn't sicken at his touch. Cronus, being Cronus, hadn't bothered to search for a suitable candidate and had simply recruited one of his prisoners&#x2014;sweet, innocent Mari.<br><br>"Cronus made a deal with the girl," Torin said.<br><br>"I know that." His obsession huffed and puffed, a veritable big, bad wolf. "Mari was cursed to flash to your bedroom one hour a day for nearly a month, all in the hopes of convincing you to touch her."<br><br>"Yes," he croaked. And in return, Cronus had promised to set her dearest friend free&#x2014;the woman currently grilling Torin for answers.<br><br>No big surprise Cronus had lied.<br><br><em>At least he got his in the end.</em><br><br>Torin had wanted to haul ass to a hospital the moment he'd realized Mari was sick, but that stupid curse had bound her to this prison with invisible chains. She'd <em>had</em> to return. Left with no other option, Torin had held on to her as she'd moved from one location to another in a blink, traveling with her. He'd tended her to the best of his ability.<br><br>But his best hadn't been good enough. Would <em>never</em> be good enough.<br><br>"I don't care about the whys," the female said. "Only the outcome. What is Mari doing <em>right now?</em>"<br><br>Decomposing.<br><br><em>Can't say it, just...can't.</em> Silent, he removed his gloves and used his hands as a shovel, throwing scoop after scoop of dirt over his shoulder. <em>Not the first makeshift grave I've dug, but I hereby vow it will be my last.</em> No more impromptu friendships. No more hopes and dreams for what could never be. <em>I'm done.</em><br><br>"Ignoring me?" she asked. "Do you have any idea the being you provoke?"<br><br>Torin never paused in his task. He would bury Mari. He would find a way out of this hellhole. He would continue the job he'd abandoned when he'd chosen to come with the girl. The search and rescue of Cameo and Viola, who'd gone missing several weeks ago&#x2014;friends who comprehended his need for distance.<br><br>"I am Keeleycael, the Red Queen, and I will be more than happy to take a coat hanger and fish out all of your internal organs...through your mouth."<br><br>Disease went still and quiet.<br><br>That, too, was a first.<br><br>The Red Queen. The title was somehow familiar to Torin. From a children's storybook, yes, but there was more to it than that. He'd heard it...where? An image flashed through his mind. A dilapidated bar in the skies. Yes, of course. While working for Zeus, the king of the Greeks, he'd tracked many fugitive immortals there. The words <em>the Red Queen</em> had been whispered behind the trembling hands of fearful men and women, right along with <em>insane</em> and <em>cruel.</em><br><br>He'd always enjoyed pitting his skills against the strongest and vilest of predators, and such a visceral reaction to the supposed Red Queen had intrigued him. But when he'd asked the whisperers who she was and what she could do, they had gone quiet.<br><br>Maybe this prisoner was the one they'd spoken of, maybe she wasn't. Hardly mattered anymore. He wouldn't be fighting her.<br><br>"Keeleycael," he said. "That's quite a mouthful. How about I call you Keeley instead?"<br><br>"An honor reserved solely for my friends. Do so at your own peril."<br><br>"Thanks. I will."<br><br>A soft snarl from her. "You may call me Your Majesty. I'll call you My Next Victim."<br><br>"I usually prefer Torin, Hotness or The Awesome." Nicknames to help smile through the pain. <em>Should probably have gone with Proctalgia Fugax&#x2014;meaning a literal pain in the ass.</em><br><br>"Why has Mari gone silent, Torin?" Keeley asked as if they were discussing nothing more important than tomorrow's dinner menu. (Rat casserole.)<br><br>She knew Mari was dead, didn't she? Making him admit it was some sort of punishment.<br><br>"Before you reply," she added, "you should know I would rather save the enemy who tells me the truth than the friend who tells me lies."<br><br>Not a bad motto. <em>Lie and die</em> happened to be his.<br><br>And, really, if the situation were reversed, he would have wanted the same thing: answers. But again, if the situation were reversed and <em>she</em> had led to the demise of one of <em>his</em> friends, he would have moved heaven and earth to administer justice. But trapped as they were in these cells created for the strongest of immortals, there was nothing she could do but stew in her rage, helpless as the emotion grew darker and darker, perhaps even driving her mad. It was a cruel fate. It was also an excuse.<br><br><em>Time to put on my big-boy panties.</em> "Mari is... Dead. She's dead." Silence.<br><br>Such oppressive silence and, with it, darkness, as if they'd somehow fallen into a sensory-deprivation tank.<br><br>He spoke in a desperate bid to dull his mounting sorrow, explaining, "Since you know about Cronus's deal with Mari, you must know I'm a Lord of the Underworld. One of the fourteen warriors responsible for stealing and opening Pandora's box, unleashing the demons from within. As punishment, we were each cursed to house one of those demons inside our own bodies. I was given Disease, the world's worst SSTD. Skin-to-skin-transmitted disease. I make people sick. That's what I do, and there's no stopping it. She touched me, like I said. We touched each other. But that's all it took. She died. She's dead," he repeated hollowly.<br><br>Again silence.<br><br>He locked his jaw to prevent himself from admitting the other Lords hosted baddies like Violence, Death and Pain.

Silver-fringed banners flapped from its towers, their emblems indistinct at this distance, but Valya knew that they showed a steely gray griffon upon a field of blue. Beneath them stood a single gate of thick wood and steel. Brother Genitivi had written in his histories that it was wide enough for three horses to pass abreast, but from where Valya stood, it was so dwarfed by Weisshaupt&#x2019;s stony bulk that it seemed tiny as her thumbnail.</p> <p>For weeks she&#x2019;d dreamed of this place. Ancient stronghold of the Grey Wardens, final resting place for the heroes of ages, first and last bulwark against the horrors of the Blights&nbsp;&#x2026; and now her home, too. The thought made her shiver with fearful delight.</p> <p>None of that excitement was reflected on her companions&#x2019; faces. The fear was there, though, despite their best efforts to mask it.</p> <p>There were four of them besides Valya&#x2014;an extraordinary number of recruits to be taken at once, she&#x2019;d been told. They ranged in age from sixteen to nineteen, except for Senior Enchanter Eilfas, whose scraggly beard was more white than brown. All of them were mages, which was another extraordinary thing. By tradition, the Wardens took only one recruit from each Circle of Magi in Thedas.</p> <p>But that tradition had been broken. Violently.</p> <p>Beginning in Kirkwall and spreading swiftly through Orlais, the mages of Thedas had found themselves hunted and hounded on all sides. The Templar Order, supposedly their protector and defender, had turned against them. How and why it had happened, Valya wasn&#x2019;t sure; she&#x2019;d been only an apprentice until a few weeks ago, so no one had told her much of anything, and the rumors were impossibly confusing.</p> <p>What she did know was that Weisshaupt, and the Grey Wardens, represented sanctuary.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Thedas, the world might have gone mad. Elsewhere, she&#x2019;d heard, entire Circles of Magi had been destroyed. Their towers had been pulled to the ground, and every mage and apprentice inside had been slaughtered&#x2014;even the little children&#x2014;for no crime beyond being born with the gift of magic. Other Circles were said to have risen up in rebellion and joined an army of mages massing somewhere around Andoral&#x2019;s Reach.</p> <p>But that was elsewhere. Not here. Here in the Anderfels, men and women remembered the true dangers of the world, and they did not waste precious lives fighting one another. When the first rumors reached their Circle, the Senior Enchanter had sent a swift message to Weisshaupt, and within days the Wardens&#x2019; reply had come back. Any mage who wished to join the Grey Wardens was welcome. No such mage was to be troubled by the templars. The Wardens&#x2019; Right of Conscription was inviolate&#x2014;and that meant its promise of sanctuary was too.</p> <p>Even so, few had chosen to accept the Wardens&#x2019; invitation. Becoming a Grey Warden meant a hard life and a sure death, one way or another. It was a noble and ancient order, its tales sung by bards across Thedas&nbsp;&#x2026; and no one, absolutely <i>no one</i>, save the truly heroic or the truly desperate, wanted to become a member.</p> <p>Valya wasn&#x2019;t sure which she was. But she knew she didn&#x2019;t want to die fighting templars, and she knew the Grey Wardens, even more than the Circle of Magi, offered a place where an elf could stand equal to any human. Nowhere else in Thedas could give her that.</p> <p>So she had packed her few belongings and announced that she would accompany Senior Enchanter Eilfas and a handful of other junior mages to Weisshaupt. To become a Grey Warden, or die trying.</p> <p>Now, under Broken Tooth&#x2019;s shadow, she could see the others regretting their decisions. It was as plain as the fear they tried so hard to hide. Templars were fanatics, but they were still men. They could be reasoned with, cajoled, bullied, bribed. There would be none of that with darkspawn. Only a hard life, and a sure death.</p> <p>Valya stepped forward, starting on the steep long road to Weisshaupt&#x2019;s gates.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>It was late afternoon when they turned onto the path to Weisshaupt, but it was fully dark by the time they reached its gates. Twice Eilfas had called a halt for water and rest. Life in the Circle&#x2019;s tower, with all those endless spiraling stairs, had kept the Senior Enchanter reasonably fit for his age, but there was nothing in any Circle of Magi that approximated the road up Broken Tooth.</p> <p>A thousand feet of vertical distance separated Weisshaupt&#x2019;s gate from the dusty earth. The path that climbed up all that stone was at least three miles of hard switchbacks punctuated by ancient carved steps where the slope was too steep to run smooth. Each step had been worn down by the boots of countless Grey Wardens through the centuries, leaving shallow bowls that sent up little puffs of bone-colored dust as the mages&#x2019; robes whisked across them.</p> <p>Narrow benches were carved into the stone at two wider points along the path, offering a spartan respite, but otherwise there was no comfort to be had on the journey up. Nor was there meant to be. The thin black slits of archers&#x2019; windows stared down at them, pointedly foreboding, but they hardly needed to be there. Anyone who tried walking up the path under the sun&#x2019;s full glare would have been defeated by heat and wind long before coming into bowshot. Even in the coolness of twilight, the walk was punishing.</p> <p>At last, just when Valya thought her legs were about to give out and send her plummeting mercifully down the mountainside, they reached the final stretch of stairs. Above them, the moon shone white in a cloudless sky; below, the blasted land of the Anderfels stretched endlessly on in shades of gray and red. A smaller door, barely visible as a shadowed indentation in the massive wall, faced them. The Senior Enchanter rapped against it with the end of his staff, and after a moment it swung inward.</p> <p>A bluff-faced woman in a gray tunic and trousers stood inside. The sleeves of the tunic had been torn off, showing arms as muscular as a blacksmith&#x2019;s. An old injury had split her lip; it had healed with a flat white mark over her front teeth, and the teeth themselves were made of silver that glinted in the starlight. A spiked war hammer hung from a well-worn loop on her belt.</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be the Hossberg mages?&#x201d; she said. Valya couldn&#x2019;t place her accent. Fereldan, maybe. She hadn&#x2019;t met many Fereldans.</p> <p>Senior Enchanter Eilfas bowed his head graciously, despite his weariness. &#x201c;We are.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Come in. I&#x2019;ll show you to your rooms. There&#x2019;ll be wash water if you want it, and food. Rest for tonight. In the morning we can talk over what you&#x2019;ll be doing.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; the Senior Enchanter said. &#x201c;May I ask your name? I am Senior Enchanter Eilfas of the Hossberg Circle&nbsp;&#x2026; or I <i>was</i>. I suppose I don&#x2019;t know if I still am. My companions are Valya, Berrith, Padin, and Sekah. They are young, but all very good. We have come to offer our skills to your cause.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sulwe,&#x201d; the silver-toothed woman said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll make good use of your talents.&#x201d; She stepped back into the fortress, receding into darkness. Eilfas lowered his staff, speaking a word, and the gem on its head began to glow softly.</p> <p>In a gentle parade of light, led by the radiant gem atop Eilfas&#x2019;s staff and carried on by the lesser magic of the students, the mages of Hossberg passed into Weisshaupt.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>At daybreak Sulwe returned and led Senior Enchanter Eilfas away for a private conference. She didn&#x2019;t tell the others where they were going, and no one asked.</p> <p>A few minutes later a handsome young elf knocked on their door. He wore the Wardens&#x2019; blue and gray with casual arrogance, but his manner was far less intimidating than Sulwe&#x2019;s military correctness had been, and he seemed scarcely five years older than any of them. His hair was the color of rich honey, and it tumbled to his shoulders in loose curls. An easy smile warmed his face. He carried a large covered basket, from which the tantalizing aroma of freshly baked bread wafted.</p> <p>Berrith, shameless at sixteen, sat up straight on her cot and tugged her blouse lower. The elven Warden seemed not to notice, except for a slight smile that teased at the corner of his mouth. He looked carefully away from the young mage as he set the basket down on a table.</p> <p>&#x201c;Welcome to Weisshaupt,&#x201d; he said. Valya happened to be sitting on the opposite side of the room as Berrith, so the Warden directed his greeting at her. &#x201c;My name is Caronel. I&#x2019;ll be handling your initial assessments and introductory lessons. Also, your breakfast.&#x201d; He gestured to the basket. &#x201c;Help yourselves. Bread and goat cheese. Plain fare, but good. We&#x2019;re not much for luxury here.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Valya stammered, because someone had to say <i>something</i>. She felt a flush creeping up her cheeks. Caronel really was unfairly handsome. To cover the redness, she stood up hastily and retrieved a chunk of bread from the basket, then passed the basket over to Sekah. &#x201c;What do you need to assess?&#x201d;</p> <p>If Caronel noticed her blush, he showed no sign of it. He sat companionably on the side of the Senior Enchanter&#x2019;s empty cot, turning so that he could see them all. &#x201c;What you learned in Hossberg. What you know about the darkspawn and the Wardens and our duties in Thedas. How strong you are in your magic, whether you have any particular talents in the art, and whether you know anything that might be of use to us already.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of questions,&#x201d; Valya murmured around a mouthful of bread. She swallowed with difficulty, glad to have an excuse for her dry mouth.</p> <p>&#x201c;We have a lot of time,&#x201d; Caronel said with a wry smile. &#x201c;Well, we have <i>some</i> time. Maybe not a lot. Let&#x2019;s start with the most crucial question: What do you know about darkspawn? Have you ever fought any?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I have,&#x201d; Sekah said. He was a small grave boy with straight dark hair and enormous eyes that made him look far younger than his sixteen years. &#x201c;Before I came to the Circle, hurlocks attacked our farm. We couldn&#x2019;t hold them off with arrows or pitchforks, so I burned them. That&#x2019;s how my magic came to me.&#x201d;</p> <p>Valya regarded her companion with surprise. She&#x2019;d never heard that story before, and had no idea he&#x2019;d survived such danger. Sekah wasn&#x2019;t even a real mage yet, strictly speaking; he hadn&#x2019;t undergone the Harrowing, which meant he was still an apprentice.</p> <p>Or maybe it didn&#x2019;t. Maybe there wouldn&#x2019;t <i>be</i> any more Harrowings now that they were all apostates. Only Circle mages had to endure that awful ritual, and there were no Circles anymore.</p> <p>In that case, maybe Sekah was the most accomplished mage among them.</p> <p>Caronel certainly seemed to be impressed. The elven Warden nodded at Sekah with real respect. Then he glanced at the others. &#x201c;And you?&#x201d;</p> <p>Mutely, Valya shook her head along with the rest of them. She&#x2019;d read about darkspawn in the histories, of course, and heard countless stories from those who had fought the horrific creatures. No child of the Anderfels, elf or human, grew up without being terrorized by bedtime tales of hurlocks and genlocks and baby-eating ogres. But she had never personally laid eyes on one, much less faced a howling horde of them in combat.</p> <p>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;ll have a lot to learn,&#x201d; Caronel said. &#x201c;<i>If</i> you become Wardens, your primary duty will, of course, be protecting the people of Thedas from the depredations of darkspawn. Not only will you have to fight against them personally, but you will have to lead others in that fight. You will need to know everything about them: their types, their tactics, and all we know about their origins and abilities.&#x201d; The elf paused. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re all mages, so I assume you can read?&#x201d;</p> <p>Valya nodded, as did her companions. Caronel gave them another approving glance. &#x201c;Very good. Then, until it&#x2019;s time for you to undergo the Joining, you can earn your keep&#x2014;and perhaps begin to learn something useful&#x2014;in our libraries.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Earn our keep how?&#x201d; Sekah asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;The Chamberlain of the Grey has requested your assistance with his research,&#x201d; Caronel said. &#x201c;You should be honored to assist. It&#x2019;s something to do with blood magic, I gather, although the chamberlain&#x2019;s being tight-lipped about the details. Old, whatever it is. But you mages love old books, don&#x2019;t you? You should have a grand time with it. All that&nbsp;&#x2026; parchment. And dust.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Blood magic?&#x201d; Sekah echoed in a whisper, casting a nervous look to Valya.</p> <p>She shared the younger boy&#x2019;s unspoken sentiments. Blood mages were feared and reviled across Thedas, for their magic drew upon pain and sacrifice, and could often be used to control the minds or bodies of others. If whatever this was involved darkspawn, too&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>Valya had never heard of darkspawn possessing such magic. She had always thought they were mindless brutes, and blood magic required considerable sophistication.</p> <p>&#x201c;Something like that,&#x201d; Caronel said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be looking for accounts where Wardens acted&nbsp;&#x2026; strangely. Disregarding their orders, abandoning their posts, things of that nature. You&#x2019;ll also be looking for mentions of unusual darkspawn&#x2014;ones who could talk and think like men. These things may occur together or separately. It doesn&#x2019;t matter. Make note of both.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not everyone who witnessed such things would have recognized them for what they were, of course. The accounts may be cryptic, and prone to exaggeration or distortion. But any reference you can find would be helpful. I understand that it may be difficult to distinguish incidents where Wardens inexplicably absconded from ordinary desertions, or from outposts that were massacred during the fighting. I also understand that the language may present some difficulty, as you&#x2019;ll be focusing on materials that may be several centuries old. Do your best.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;When would you like us to begin?&#x201d; Valya asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Today,&#x201d; Caronel replied. He stood, brushing invisible wrinkles from his deep blue tunic. &#x201c;As soon as you&#x2019;re done eating, in fact.&#x201d;</p> <p>The conversation died out after that. Valya, alight with nervous excitement, had to force herself to swallow her food. As hungry as she&#x2019;d been before, the bread and cheese now seemed as flavorless as sawdust.</p> <p>When they&#x2019;d finished eating, Caronel led them from their room down a long dusty hallway. To their right, the stone walls were hung with tapestries of plate-clad Wardens mounted on griffons and raining death down on armies of shrieking darkspawn. To the left, archers&#x2019; slits allowed just enough sunlight to bring out the tapestries&#x2019; faded hues.</p> <p>Weapons were mounted between some of the tapestries. They looked like darkspawn weapons: savagery crystallized in black, cruel and clumsy and terrifying. Old stains covered their blades. Blood, maybe. Or something worse. Valya couldn&#x2019;t tell. Shivering, she averted her eyes.</p> <p>&#x201c;You have to look,&#x201d; Sekah whispered by her elbow. The boy&#x2019;s eyes were fixed on a dented, bloodied shield. &#x201c;You have to bear witness and understand why it is so important to stop them. The Joining, the Calling&nbsp;&#x2026; it&#x2019;s all worthwhile if it holds back the darkspawn. Once you understand what they <i>are</i>.&#x201d;</p> <p>Valya shook her head, her lips pressed tightly. But she looked up, briefly, at the ancient weapons nailed to the walls, and the tapestries that commemorated the grisly battles in which those weapons had presumably been taken. And then she cast her eyes downward, shivering again, and kept her gaze fixed on her own toes as Caronel led them away through the hall and down a sweeping flight of stairs and into Weisshaupt&#x2019;s great library.</p> <p>It was an awe-inspiring sight, more of a cathedral than a library. ...</p></p><h2>The Winter Father (Collected Short Stories and Novellas)</h2><p>While the title novella of Dubus's Finding a Girl in America returns to the somewhat off-the-rails literary life of Hank Allison, the collection's opening story strikes a much darker tone: "Killings"-the basis of the Academy Award-nominated film In the Bedroom-is a swift tale of revenge that leaves readers wondering what they might do in the name of family love.<br><br>Dubus's prowess with narrative compression is on full display in the story "Waiting": the hollow ache experienced by a woman widowed by the Korean war took Dubus fourteen months to write and was more than one hundred pages in early manuscript form...but spans a mere seven pages in published form.<br><br>Writing in the New York Times Book Review, Joyce Carol Oates called "The Pretty Girl"-the opening novella of The Times Are Never So Bad-"the most compelling and suspenseful work of fiction [Dubus] has written."<br><br>Richard Russo's introduction to this volume grapples with his complex feelings on reading Dubus's work over many decades, but when it comes to the much-anthologized masterpiece "A Father's Story," Russo writes: "I won't mince words.

Perhaps with the nation&#x2019;s first female President, equal pay on the horizon, true diversity in the workplace to come thereafter? Or, at least the end of &#x201c;fat-shaming&#x201d; and &#x201c;locker room talk&#x201d;?&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Well, we aren&#x2019;t quite there yet. But does that mean that progress for women in business has come to a screeching halt?&nbsp; It&#x2019;s true that the old rules didn&#x2019;t get us as far as we hoped. But we <i>can </i>go the distance, and we <i>can </i>close the gaps that still exist. We just need a new way.<br> &nbsp;<br> In fact, there are many reasons to be optimistic about the future, says former Wall Street powerhouse-turned-entrepreneur Sallie Krawcheck. &nbsp;That&#x2019;s because the business world is changing fast &#x2013;driven largely by technology - and it&#x2019;s changing in ways that give us more power and opportunities than ever...and even more than we yet realize. &nbsp;<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> Success for professional women will no longer be<i> </i>about trying to compete at the men&#x2019;s version of the game, she says. And it will no longer be about contorting ourselves to men&#x2019;s expectations of how powerful people behave. Instead, it&#x2019;s about embracing and investing in our innate strengths as women - and bringing them proudly and unapologetically, to work. <br> &nbsp;<br> When we do, she says, we gain the power to advance in our careers in more natural ways. We gain the power to initiate courageous conversations in the workplace. We gain the power to forge non-traditional career paths; to leave companies that don&#x2019;t respect our worth, and instead, go start our own. And we gain the power to invest our economic muscle in making our lives, and the world, better.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here Krawcheck draws on her experiences at the highest levels of business, both as one of the few women at the top rungs of the biggest boy&#x2019;s club in the world, and as an entrepreneur, to show women how to seize this seismic shift in power to take their careers to the next level.<b> </b><br> &nbsp;<br> This change is real, and it&#x2019;s coming fast. It&#x2019;s time to own it.</p><p><b>Sallie Krawcheck</b> is the Co-founder and CEO of Ellevest, an innovative digital investment platform designed to help women reach their financial goals.

Krawcheck attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and holds an MBA from Columbia University.<p>Chapter 1</p><p>How the World of Work Is Changing--and Why That&#x2019;s Good News for Women</p><p>Ask for the raise. Negotiate like a man, but not too much like a man. Be helpful in the office, but don&#x2019;t become the work wife. But do find a work husband. Use silence as a tool. Speak up. But don&#x2019;t up-speak. Lower your voice to be really heard. Develop the all-important gravitas. Be forceful, but not too forceful, or you won&#x2019;t be likable. Dress like your boss.</p><p>The advice out there for women in the workplace is dizzying, and I haven&#x2019;t even gotten to the whole work-life balance debate: We can have it all! Oh no, wait, we can&#x2019;t? Well, maybe we can, but only if we don&#x2019;t expect to have it all at once . . . or if we marry just the right person . . . or if we have our kids early . . . or later . . . but not too late. . . .</p><p>It all boils down to the same advice: &#x201c;Change.&#x201d; And even &#x201c;Act more like . . . you know . . . a man.&#x201d;</p><p>It&#x2019;s exhausting.</p><p>It can&#x2019;t be denied that, to quote the great Loretta Lynn, we&#x2019;ve come a long way, baby. I&#x2019;m proof positive of that. In my grandmothers&#x2019;--and even my mother&#x2019;s--generation, a woman like me at the senior levels of Wall Street, the ultimate boys&#x2019; club, holding top jobs at some of the biggest financial firms on the planet, and now founding my own digital investment start-up, Ellevest, would have been unheard of.</p><p>But here&#x2019;s the thing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, I didn&#x2019;t do it by following the old rules. I didn&#x2019;t do it by trying to &#x201c;act like a man,&#x201d; or &#x201c;beat them at their own game.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t do it &#x201c;in spite of&#x201d; being a woman.</p><p>With hindsight I can see that I did it because I&#x2019;m a woman, because I embraced and invested in the powerful and unique strengths that, research shows, can make women valuable employees, terrific team players, and effective leaders. And because I brought those qualities--unabashedly and unapologetically--to work.</p><p>Did I encounter my share of sexism along the way? You know it, and you&#x2019;ll read some of these harrowing stories in this book. (For example, in the early days of my career, every day began with me finding a photocopy of a penis on my desk. Every day. Bright side: I managed to keep in shape by using the stairs to do all of my copying on a different floor.)</p><p>And was my career a straight line? Absolutely not. I&#x2019;ll talk about how holding true to those same qualities meant that I also had some real--and public--career setbacks, but I&#x2019;ll also talk about how those same qualities helped me bounce back from them, and even move my career further forward in the process.</p><p>Has my success as a woman in a man&#x2019;s world been, in many ways, the exception rather than the rule? You can bet your bottom dollar on that, too. When I worked on senior management teams on Wall Street, there was rarely a time when I wasn&#x2019;t the only woman--or one of only a couple of women--in the room. Still today, just 4 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are women,1 and women make up less than 19 percent of the members of corporate boards.2 There are literally more men named John, Robert, William, or James on corporate boards than there are women.3 And when women do move into senior business roles, it&#x2019;s still so rare--so utterly astounding--that it garners press attention, always with the tired, but inevitable, questions about work-life balance, how does she do it . . . and, too often, the even more insulting question of what is she wearing while she&#x2019;s doing it.</p><p>What&#x2019;s more, we women still earn just 78 cents on men&#x2019;s dollar--52&#x2013;64 cents if we are women of color.4 At this rate, we won&#x2019;t reach gender pay parity until 2133.5 Professional women overwhelmingly report that gender discrimination still exists at their companies: some 63 percent say it is subtle and 26 percent say it&#x2019;s overt.6 And after all of our hard work, we women do not invest our earnings into the markets to the same extent men do; depending on our income, this can cost us literally hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of dollars over the course of our lifetimes. All of this can leave us financially dependent--on men.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve come a long way, baby. But some things are still a little 1958.</p><p>If our economy were humming along, we might sigh and dismiss all this as a &#x201c;feminist issue.&#x201d; But we don&#x2019;t have the luxury of throwing up our hands and declaring it something for the Gloria Steinems of the next generations to sort out. The fact is that the gender gap in business and in investing has coincided with chronic underemployment, sluggish economic growth, the retirement savings crisis, growing income inequality, and fear for the future of the middle class.</p><p>But this is all ripe for change, and that change can come fast.</p><p>I would go so far as to say that we are at a major turning point in the role of women at work. The role of women is on the brink of change because the world of business is on the brink of change--the kind of change, as you&#x2019;ll read in the pages ahead, that gives us more power in the workforce than ever.</p><p>So what is driving this change? And why can it happen now?</p><p>I believe there are four key catalysts.</p><p>1. The Increasing Recognition of What We Women&nbsp; Bring to the Party</p><p>For years, as I said earlier, I sort of fought the idea that women are &#x201c;different&#x201d; from men. . . . Hey, we&#x2019;re all just people, and each of us is unique. I always resisted the notion that either gender--men or women--might possess inherent qualities that made it inherently &#x201c;different&#x201d; or &#x201c;better&#x201d; at business than the other. But as a &#x201c;recovering research analyst,&#x201d; I always try to let the research speak to me, and when I began to drill down on these issues, what I found surprised me. The research shows that women do bring &#x201c;different&#x201d; traits to the office that are good for business. Okay, even great for business. Among them: advanced risk awareness; a holistic perspective and ability to juggle complexity and multitask; long-term thinking; a focus on relationships and team building; a love of lifelong learning; and acute awareness of meaning, purpose, and social impact.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll spend time on each of these traits in Chapter 2, where we&#x2019;ll talk about the evidence showing how these traits can make us, to put it bluntly, pretty awesome: awesome leaders, awesome team members, and awesome employees. And why that in turn means that more women, and particularly more women in leadership positions, make those more diverse companies more innovative, more profitable, and better places to work.</p><p>Think I&#x2019;m exaggerating?</p><p>Study after study shows that the companies with greater gender diversity outperform others on many measures. These include: Improved financial performance, in some cases dramatically better performance, with higher returns on investment, lower risk, narrower gender pay gaps, greater long-term focus, and lower cost of borrowing.7 Better customer service and better public image.8 Increased ability to attract the best talent.9 More creative and effective decision making. The power of diversity is so great that more diverse teams outperform &#x201c;smarter&#x201d; ones.10 (Okay, wow.)</p><p>Benefits also include: Higher worker engagement and better morale.11 (This is a biggie.) Increased innovation.12 (Yes, you read that correctly.) Better stockholder returns.13 (You read that one correctly, too. And that&#x2019;s not just true over time, but is recognized pretty quickly by the market.) And if your company is a start-up, the benefits of diversity exist there, too. Again, not by a little: one source reports 63 percent better investment performance from companies with a female founder.14</p><p>The research is loud and clear: a company with women in leadership positions is healthier on every level, and can bring out the best in everyone.</p><p>The fact that this research exists in the first place is a sign of the growing recognition of the power of women in the workplace and in the economy and reflects an emerging understanding of the qualities we women bring to the party. It&#x2019;s evidence that the view that closing the gender gaps at work can be good for everybody (not just women themselves) is beginning to take hold.</p><p>So this is good.</p><p>But is this recognition enough to drive real change? Is it enough to convince those already in power to work to toss aside whatever gender stereotypes or misconceptions they adhere to (you know, such as that women aren&#x2019;t &#x201c;tough enough&#x201d; to succeed in the cutthroat, high-rung world of business, or are &#x201c;too emotional&#x201d; to make strong leaders)? Is it enough to persuade them to further open the doors for people who are not a lot like them? Is it enough to convince the boss to promote Susie instead of Jimmy (even though Jimmy reminds him so darn much of himself when he was younger . . .) in pursuit of the positive ripple effects of diversity?</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>But also maybe not.</p><p>And it may not matter. Because here&#x2019;s what else is different going forward.&nbsp;</p><p>2. The Business World Is Rapidly Changing . . . and So Are the Drivers of Success--in a Way That Makes the Skills We Women Bring to the Workplace More Valuable than Ever</p><p>I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s controversial to say that technology is fundamentally changing the workplace as we know it.</p><p>Remember when gathering information was costly and took forever? Remember when the only ways to engage with the customer at scale were through magazines, newspapers, and broadcast TV? Remember when you could dictate to the customer, and they had no way to talk back?</p><p>Well, all of that has changed, and the pace of further change is only increasing. Success at work now is less about having and hoarding information and more about the ability to analyze and synthesize that information with acuity. It&#x2019;s less about simply building the best product and hoping for the money to follow and more about building the kinds of relationships with customers that sustain profits over the long term. Business is more complex, and so it requires the ability to make and understand connections, the ability to see the forest through the trees.</p><p>The ability to see problems holistically, emotional intelligence, communication--things we females can be awfully good at--thus matter more every day. So the workplace is changing in ways that, research shows, play to women&#x2019;s innate skills. And in turn the more that we invest in these skills--skills like empathy, love of learning, and acute awareness of purpose--the better positioned we can be to succeed.</p><p>But that&#x2019;s not all.</p><p>3. Technology Is Also Increasing Our Career Options . . . and Thus Increasing Our Power</p><p>When I ran Merrill Lynch, we had in place an investment platform (the most whiz-bang, the most advanced one in the industry) that cost more than $1 billion to build.</p><p>Today I run Ellevest. We have built an investment platform that doesn&#x2019;t have all the bells and whistles of Merrill&#x2019;s, and uses as much third-party software as possible as its building blocks, but accomplishes the same fundamental functions--at a tiny fraction of what Merrill spent to put its platform in place. Teeny tiny.</p><p>This is but one example of how, thanks to technology, all kinds of barriers to starting businesses are coming down--and fast. As recently as five years ago, if you wanted to start a business, you had to rent long-term office space, buy expensive servers, hire coders and programmers, figure out how to put in place HR systems, and so on. Today you can store information in the cloud, hire freelancers, and rent short-term space at a WeWork, all for a fraction of the cost. While venture capitalists don&#x2019;t &#x201c;get it&#x201d; on women (and particularly women of color), the sources of capital for starting businesses are expanding--think crowdfunding and angel investing groups. So while it&#x2019;s by no means easy to start a business (trust me on this), it is easier, and cheaper.</p><p>That is why more and more people--and more and more women--can leave the more traditional, corporate career path behind for the world of entrepreneurship. Just look at the businesses that are being built by women, like Jessica Herrin at Stella and Dot, Julie Wainwright at The RealReal, Jennifer Hyman at Rent the Runway, Alli Webb at Drybar, and many, many more. So not only do we now have the tools to make the plunge into entrepreneurship easier and are able to start businesses more easily; we&#x2019;re also getting a critical mass of role models who are making this career path feel more attainable than ever.</p><p>Thus, it may be no wonder that women are now starting businesses at double the rate of men.15 (And the bonus is that a good number of these businesses are themselves focused on the female customer, making our lives better and, in some cases, more fun.)</p><p>I get that throwing yourself whole hog into starting your own business isn&#x2019;t for everyone, nor does everyone have the financial resources to do so. But today&#x2019;s technology also offers us an intermediate step, since these same tools are also enabling the explosion of flexible and part-time work, to the point that these forms of employment have become true career paths; and these can be ones that can coexist with the demands of family in a way that many full-time corporate jobs still don&#x2019;t.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.

Others confront our epidemic of anxiety with fierce resistance, or "the fight to be right," criticizing anyone and everyone just to end up stuck. In the face of such pervasive human suffering, New York Times best-selling author and legendary life coach Iyanla Vanzant challenges us: What if it&#x2019;s not them&#x2014;what if it&#x2019;s you? What if you need to "get over it"&#x2014;and get over yourself? Because no matter how much we would like to blame people and circumstances beyond our control, the truth is staggeringly simple: anything and everything we experience is a function of what and how we think. In Get Over It! Iyanla offers a unique spiritual technology called "thought therapy," a process that harnesses proven spiritual tools with the science of neuroplasticity. The 42 prayers and affirmations, and complementary energy-clearing tools at the heart of the thought therapy process are designed to neutralize and eliminate the unconscious, unproductive, soul-destroying dominant negative thought patterns (DNTPs) and discordant emotional energies, allowing you to get to the root cause of your personal suffering, and make life-affirming choices. If you&#x2019;re ready to break free of your ego&#x2019;s resistance and willing to face yourself, willing to change, and willing to heal and grow&#x2014;then now&#x2019;s the time to Get Over It!</p><p>Iyanla Vanzant is one of the country&#x2019;s most celebrated writers and public speakers, and she&#x2019;s among the most infl uential, socially engaged, and acclaimed spiritual life coaches of our time. Host and executive producer of the award-winning hit Iyanla: Fix My Life on OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network, Iyanla&#x2019;s focus on faith, empowerment, and loving relationships has inspired millions around the world.

Author Carolyn Baker offers wisdom, inspiration, and a sense of spiritual purpose for anyone who is concerned about the daunting future humankind has created.<br><br>The author's introduction to&nbsp;<i>Collapsing Consciously</i>&nbsp;articulates our current predicament of economic collapse, environmental degradation, and global conflict and expresses the confusion, anxiety, grief, anger, and despair we all experience when we take a hard look at the present-day global crisis and the likely future of the planet. But rather than showing us ways to prevent the collapse, Baker argues that the demise of our consumerist, corporate culture is inevitable, and that it is crucial to prepare emotionally and spiritually for the certain changes to come.<br><br>Part 1 is a collection of seventeen essays which argue that while the collapse of industrial society cannot be prevented, its meaning extends far beyond tragedy and loss. These essays ask the reader to delve inward and discover the limitless treasures of the soul, as well as the gratification and exhilaration to be discovered in joining with community in preparing for the future.<br><br>In part 2, Baker offers fifty-two weekly meditations comprised of spiritual wisdom, inspiration, paradox, comfort, humor, irony, and a persistent challenge to create and savor beauty in the world, regardless of how bleak the future may appear.<br><br><i>Collapsing Consciously</i>&nbsp;is a refreshing take on the perilous present and the grim prospects for our future. Instead of quoting discouraging statistics about our predicament, Baker offers a deeper perspective that makes sense of a world that most of the time appears psychotic or even surreal.

The culmination of Cooper&#39;s explorations into sex and death, youth culture, and the search for the ineffable object of desire, Period is a breathtaking, mesmerizing final statement to the five-book cycle it completes. Cooper has taken his familiar themes -- strangely irresistible and interchangeable young men, passion that crosses into murder, the lure of drugs, the culpabilities of authorship, and the inexact, haunting communication of feeling-and melded them into a novel of flawless form and immense power. Set in a spare, smoke-and-mirror-filled world of secret Web sites, Goth bands, Satanism, pornography, and outsider art, Period is a literary disappearing act as mysterious as it is logical. Obsessive, beautiful, and darkly comic, Period is a stunning achievement from one of America&#39;s finest writers.</p><p>Dennis Cooper is the winner of the Ferro-Grumley Award for Closer, and Guide was a Los Angeles Times bestseller and one of its Ten Best Books of the Year. He lives in Los Angeles.Cooper's fans will not be surprised, but the uninitiated may balk at his new novel's macabre world of disaffected young men engaging in Satanic sacrifice, gang rape, cutting-edge pornography and nonchalant mutilation and murder. Undaunted readers will find a subversive brilliance and considerable wit behind this darkly comic ride through the looking glass of marginal youth culture. Cooper (Closer; Frisk; Try; Guide) imbues the fifth and final novel in his "Sex and Death" series with a mythic tone, centering the action in a remote, nondescript town and a mysterious house, all black on the inside except for a large mirror. Events take place on both sides of the mirror in two (or more) equally dangerous worlds that reflect and affect one another. But that is only the beginning of the mirror imagery. The main characters are a string of young men who eerily resemble each other, including voyeurs Leon and Nate, pothead Dagger, and Nate's boyfriend Bob, who's obsessed with dead-ex George. And there is a novel called Period within this novel, which a Satanic band called the Omen have popularized among their Goth followers. A cabal of pornographic Webmasters and their online audience likewise celebrate the inner novel, which also features a cast of interchangeable young men, a nondescript town and its mysterious house. As the two narratives, the characters and locations mirror each other, it eventually becomes clear that reality is only a series of endless reflections. Cooper plumbs themes of obsession, love, identity, authorial paradox and communication breakdown with virtuosic narrative technique. And he succeeds in wringing insight and even humor from abhorrent visions of sadism and blackness.

That was one thing. But in that preface Luther also implored the reader of his Latin writings "for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself to read those things judiciously, yes, with great commiseration".

Passionate about the land and the bounty it produced, their love of food and the art of eating created what would ultimately become America's diverse food culture.</p> <p>Like many of today's foodies, the Founding Fathers were ardent supporters of sustainable farming and ranching, exotic imported foods, brewing, distilling, and wine appreciation. Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin penned original recipes, encouraged local production of beer and wine, and shared their delight in food with friends and fellow politicians.</p> <p>In <i>The Founding Foodies</i>, food writer Dave DeWitt entertainingly describes how some of America's most famous colonial leaders not only established America's political destiny, but also revolutionized the very foods we eat.</p> <p><b>Features over thirty authentic colonial recipes, including:</b></p> <ul> <li>Thomas Jefferson's ice cream</li> <li>A recipe for beer by George Washington</li> <li>Martha Washington's fruitcake</li> <li>Medford rum punch</li> <li>Terrapin soup</li> </ul></p><p>Dave DeWitt is a leading food expert. He has authored several books and has appeared everywhere from the Today show to Mythbusters. He has also been featured in the New Yorker, the New York Times, USA Today, and approximately 200 newspapers across the country.<p><b><i>Introduction</i></b></p> <p><b>Foodies and Polymaths</b></p> <p><i>Few scholars are cooks-and fewer cooks scholars. Perhaps this accounts for the fact that no other aspect of human endeavor has been so neglected by historians as home cooking.</i><br> -Food historian Karen Hess in <i>Martha Washington's Booke of Cookery</i>, 1981</p> <p>In April 1962, two months before I graduated from James Madison High School in Vienna, Virginia, President John F. Kennedy, at a dinner honoring Nobel Prize winners of the Western Hemisphere, paid homage to Thomas Jefferson's wide-ranging interests and talents when he remarked, "I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone." Five months later, I was enrolled at Mr. Jefferson's Academical Village, the University of Virginia, and was living in Echol's Hall as an Echol's Scholar.</p> <p>To say that Jefferson was-and still is-worshipped at the university is an understatement. His legacy lingers everywhere, from the serpentine walls he designed for the gardens to the buildings he modeled after Greco-Roman structures and the statues of him and of George Washington opposite each other on the lawn. The story went that, if a virginal woman passed between the two statues, Mr. Washington would bow to Mr. Jefferson.</p> <p>It was a tradition that we wore coats and ties to class. We were not required to do this, of course, but everyone dressed up because we were Virginia gentlemen (we even drank that brand of bourbon!). Our "uniform" was a blue blazer, khaki slacks, a light-blue button-down shirt (Gant, of course), a rep tie in the university's colors of orange and navy blue, and Weejun penny loafers with no socks in warm weather. One morning during my first year, on the way to take an exam that I had studied most of the night for, I was crossing the lawn when I passed Dr. Edgar F. Shannon, the president of the university. I was mortified because that morning I had skipped the tie, but Dr. Shannon made no mention of it. He merely said, "Good morning, David." Unbelievable-he had remembered my name after a single meeting months earlier at an Echol's Scholar orientation party.</p> <p>My education at the university-I majored in English and took creative writing courses-ultimately led to my writing career, but not before a radical change in focus. No longer would I specialize in animal symbolism in the novels of James Joyce, my masters' thesis title; I would study and write about my first loves, food history and cooking.</p> <p>Jefferson became my most significant hero. After I graduated from the university in 1966, I knew from the history I had absorbed that Thomas Jefferson was the ultimate multitalented and multidimensional historical figure. But I didn't know about his love of food and wine until many years later, when I began to read more history, especially more food history. Jefferson's name appeared time and time again in the history of wine, horticulture, and food importation. While working on <i>Da Vinci's Kitchen</i>, I consulted Silvano Serventi and Fran�oise Sabban's <i>Pasta: The Story of a Universal Food </i>and discovered that Jefferson was widely credited with being the first American to import pasta into the new United States. It wasn't precisely true, but that did it-I was hooked.</p> <p>During my subsequent research, I realized that the story of early American food and wine was not just about Jefferson but also included Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and many obscure but brilliant individuals who became my "founding foodies." I decided that this was a food history that had to be written, but there were obstacles. The first and most important challenge was the lingering reputation of colonial-era food-it was not good at all, according to most accounts.</p> <p>But in 1977, food historians John Hess and Karen Hess wrote this in <i>The Taste of America</i>: "Thus, in this bicentennial period, such quasi-official historians as Daniel J. Boorstin and James Beard assure us that we have never had it so good-that Colonial Americans were primitives and ignoramuses in matters gastronomic. The truth is almost precisely to the contrary. The Founding Fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and of their intelligence." My research proves that the Hess theory is true, and what I've learned has opened a window into the past culinary triumphs of those founding foodies.</p> <p>After I developed the concept for this book, I returned to the University of Virginia in 2007 to participate in a tour of Virginia vineyards conducted by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. The program was excellent, with a private tour of Monticello and the location of Jefferson's failed vineyards. There were lectures on Jefferson's influence on wine and wine making in the United States, and we saw a very nicely produced PBS video documentary titled <i>The Cultivated Life: Thomas Jefferson and Wine</i>. While I was in Virginia, I also took a tour of George Washington's Mount Vernon and the restored gristmill and distillery, and I was impressed by the detailed exhibits that revealed Washington's importance in colonial whiskey making, farming, and ranching. The return to Virginia gave me a renewed sense of both place and history. My journey to write <i>Founding Foodies </i>has been long, but that now seems fitting, because I knew I had finally learned enough to attempt such a challenging project.<br> <br> The term <i>foodie </i>encompasses a devotion to food in its many contexts. I've decided to use the word <i>foodie </i>in this book because I have been unable to find a better, more inclusive term that describes food devotion. <i>Gourmet </i>applies in only some cases of food devotion, not, for example, to people who devoted their lives to agricultural experimentation to find better crops. Likewise, <i>epicure</i>, <i>gastronome</i>, and <i>gourmand </i>do not work in the broad contexts that this book explores.</p> <p>So what is a foodie? The restaurant critic Gael Greene coined the term <i>foodie </i>in the early 1980s, and it moved into common usage when foodies became the targets-and the heroes-of Ann Barr and Paul Levy's 1984 book <i>The Official Foodie Handbook</i>. In that prescient and hilarious work, the authors defined a foodie as "a person who is very, very, very interested in food. Foodies are the ones talking about food in any gathering-salivating over restaurants, recipes, radicchio. They don't think they are being trivial-foodies consider food to be an art, on a level with painting or drama...The purpose of life is eating well."</p></p><h2>The Tarot: History, Mystery and Lore</h2><p>With more than 40 illustrations and an entertaining informative text, this elegantly designed book captures the scope, powers, and romance of the Tarot throughout the ages. &#34;Excellently researched, entertainingly and compellingly written&#34;. -Booklist.</p><p>Giles, a tarot card reader and a student of Jungian psychology, views the tarot deck as a map of the archetypal realm of the imagination, a symbolic language capable of representing almost any human situation, and a therapeutic tool that operates on rational, psychic and metaphysical levels at once. But this confusing study does not effectively demonstrate how the tarot reader accomplishes any of the above. It does provide a colorful history of the tarot, however, which apparently began as a 15th-century Italian card game and later became overlaid with associations to fortune-telling, magic, alchemy, Kabbalism, Jungian theory and, more recently, to goddess-worship and shamanism. Giles examines surrealist artists' use of tarot imagery, presents woolly speculations on the "new physics" and includes "quantum exercises for Tarot readers," a consumer's guide to tarot decks, tips on the use of tarot in self-analysis and an annotated listing of tarot-related books and periodicals. Illustrations. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.This excellent work traces the history, legends, and stories surrounding tarot cards. The origin of these cards tarot are lost. Consequently, the tarot has generated a wealth of speculation and pseudotruths. Giles, a reader, teacher, and consultant on the tarot, gives a fascinating precis of its history from the first mention in 1450 to modern times. In addition, the role of the tarot as a way of knowing is effectively examined. This is not a guide for using tarot but a literate study of the history, foundation, and uses of the cards. There is a list of the different kinds of decks available as well as a resource list. The thoroughly annotated bibliography, based on the author's personal preferences, is very good.

George always wanted to let you know how he felt. Sometimes he wanted to cuss at you. He liked it if you cussed back at him. He wanted to motivate you. To him, the cussing and the motivating were one and the same. It happened to so many guys, so many days. Especially this season. But this wasn&#x2019;t just any other day during the 1978 New York Yankees season. This was hours before the biggest game of the year. One of the biggest games in Yankees history. Arguably one of the biggest games in baseball history. George being George, the loudmouthed, pushy, in-your-face owner of the Yankees, he wanted to have words with his starting pitcher before the game. That starting pitcher was me. And I wanted none of it.</p><p><i>&#x201c;WHERE&#x2019;S GATOR!?&#x201d;</i> he bellowed.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t a question so much as a demand. If he wanted to talk to you, he expected an audience. In a couple of hours, we were set to play a one-game tiebreaker to decide the American League East. This was the first tiebreaker since baseball adopted divisions in 1969. And it wasn&#x2019;t against just any team. It was against the Boston Red Sox.</p><p>The game was straight out of a Hollywood script. Forget all of our internal mayhem from that season&#x2014;the constant drama surrounding Reggie Jackson, the departure of our fiery and disagreeable manager, Billy Martin, and more. Boston against New York transcended all of that. There was the historical aspect: the Curse of the Bambino and the Red Sox spending decades, over half a century, nipping at our heels. There was what had happened this year: baseball&#x2019;s &#x201c;Boston Massacre,&#x201d; in which the Red Sox led the division by fourteen games during the middle of the summer, only to give it away. Then, in the final week, they won eight in a row to tie it back up on the very last day. We were both 99&#x2013;63. A coin was flipped, and the tiebreaker would be played at Fenway Park. A 163rd game in a 162-game season. One game to settle it all.</p><p><i>&#x201c;WHERE&#x2019;S GATOR!?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i>My teammates didn&#x2019;t know where I was. Neither did our manager, Bob Lemon. Only one person in the clubhouse, our trainer, Gene Monahan, knew where I was hiding out. I had snuck into the training room to take a nap. I lay down beneath the training table, and Geno threw a couple of sheets over it so nobody could see me. People popped in and out of the office asking Geno if he had seen me. Geno shrugged and said he hadn&#x2019;t. When George got around to asking him, Geno said I might be collecting my thoughts out on the field. So off George went, furiously stomping around the dewy Fenway grass in search of his starting pitcher. Meanwhile, I was sound asleep.</p><p>I knew George would be coming for me. But I didn&#x2019;t need anybody screaming at me. I knew exactly how big this game was; nobody had to remind me. So I didn&#x2019;t read the papers. If I was watching TV and a story about the game came up, I&#x2019;d change the channel. I knew the entire country would be watching. Red Sox broadcaster Ned Martin said it best. &#x201c;If there is anything going on in the world today,&#x201d; he mused, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what it is.&#x201d;</p><p>There were a bunch of reasons I could&#x2019;ve been worried. Probably should&#x2019;ve been worried. The Red Sox were every bit as good as us. The ninety-nine wins apiece said it all. Normally, ninety-nine wins would have won the division running away. Their lineup may have been the best in baseball. And they were red hot, winners of eight in a row. Moreover, the game was being played on their turf, Fenway Park. I was pitching on three days of rest, as opposed to my customary four. I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t have my best stuff.</p><p>But every step that had led me to this point in the season told me to ignore all of that. If you get caught up in it, you&#x2019;re likely to forget what your job is. I was brought up to be self-reliant and patient, something my long road to the majors reinforced, like crossbeams in a renovation. That&#x2019;s the reason I was here. That I was able to take a nap underneath the training table two hours before the first pitch should tell you everything you need to know about how worried I was.</p><p>The 1978 Yankees season might have been the most famous soap opera in baseball history. The lead actors in the drama: owner George Steinbrenner, who fought and fired his manager, Billy Martin, after Billy told the press that Reggie Jackson and George deserved each other&#x2014;one&#x2019;s a liar, the other&#x2019;s convicted. The manager who feuded with his players, suspending Reggie for five days after a game against Kansas City in which Reggie defied Billy by attempting to bunt. The players who butted heads with one another. The hurt feelings and catfights. The drama had a full complement of characters. Come to think of it, I&#x2019;m not sure whether it was a soap opera or a three-ringed circus. And it all took place on the biggest stage in sports, New York City, and on the most popular team in the history of America&#x2019;s national pastime. The fireworks and explosions rocked the entire country, on the front and back pages of the newspapers, on television, and on sports radio.</p><p>In the span of a couple of years I had gone from relative anonymity&#x2014;a good old boy from Lafayette, Louisiana&#x2014;to become the ace of the pitching staff. I knew the team depended on me, as much as anybody, to win. On the other hand, I was never the source of the team&#x2019;s drama. The reasons varied, but other folks&#x2014;from Reggie to Billy to George to Sparky Lyle&#x2014;were central figures of the discontent. I didn&#x2019;t have a beef with anybody. I tended to keep to myself and focus on doing my job in the best way I knew how. But that didn&#x2019;t mean I didn&#x2019;t observe what was going on. I was never far from it, but because I wasn&#x2019;t personally involved, I felt like I had the right distance to get some perspective about not just what happened but why it turned out the way it did&#x2014;with us winning it all. You see, I&#x2019;m not sure we would have won the World Series if all of that didn&#x2019;t go down. We may not have won if Billy remained our manager. We may not have won if our guys had issues but didn&#x2019;t hash them out.</p><p>The postmortems of the 1978 team centered on one fundamental question: How the heck did such a dysfunctional cast of stars and misfits manage to win it all? An ESPN miniseries about the team was called <i>The Bronx Is Burning</i>. Reliever Sparky Lyle wrote a book about the team, called <i>The Bronx Zoo,</i> that spent half a year on the bestseller lists. And so forth. In other words, you wouldn&#x2019;t blame anyone for thinking that we had no business winning the World Series. You&#x2019;d expect the story of the 1978 Yankees to be a narrative of a dysfunctional team going down in flames.</p><p>But that didn&#x2019;t happen. The way I see it, the 1978 Yankees didn&#x2019;t win <i>in spite</i> of what went down that season. We won <i>because </i>of what happened. A team that is willing to fight&#x2014;even one another&#x2014;can go one of two ways: into the toilet or into greatness. A team that is afraid of conflict can settle into complacency. That was not us. We were a team with the potential to be great. And I believe that out of all the craziness, we became a team that was both talented and fearless. We were hungry. We were relentless. We were fiercely competitive. And we came together as a team over the course of the season. I believe we were the smartest, most complete baseball team around. Far from dysfunctional, we did all the little things it takes to be great. And nowhere was all of that better demonstrated than in that play-off game against the Red Sox.</p><p>The day before, Sunday, October l, the last day of the regular season, I was thinking about pitching on the next Tuesday in the first game of the play-offs, against Kansas City. We had won six in a row. Boston had won seven in a row. We led them by a game, so all we had to do was win our last game, against Cleveland, or have Boston lose, and we&#x2019;d be in the play-offs. We were rolling, and we were playing against one of the worst teams in the league. But we lost the game 9&#x2013;2. And when Boston beat Toronto 5&#x2013;0, we were tied at ninety-nine wins apiece.</p><p>After we lost, I walked past Bob Lemon in the dugout and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pitch tomorrow.&#x201d; I felt I had earned the right to decide that for myself&#x2014;and the team. I had the most wins in baseball, twenty-four, against only three losses. My earned run average was the lowest in baseball; my nine shutouts, again, the most in baseball. Everyone told me I was a shoo-in to win the American League Cy Young. At that point, if I asked for the ball, I got it.</p><p>The only thing was, typically pitchers get four days of rest between starts. Pitching against Boston had me on three days of rest. And I had thrown my prior two starts on short rest, too. That was both good and bad. I had proven I could handle it. We won both games, and I had thrown a complete game each time. A total of eighteen innings, with six hits and just one run. But consecutive starts on short rest also meant my arm was even more taxed than usual.</p><p>The main thing I needed to think about was how the short rest would affect me. If the good Lord gave me the ability to throw ninety-five miles per hour, I would. At the same time, I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to throw a hundred pitches at ninety-five. Maybe fifty or sixty pitches. That one less day of rest, for a power pitcher, meant a lot. But I knew I could still get people out, even the mighty Red Sox, at ninety-two miles per hour. I just had to be smart about what to throw, and where, and when to dial it up and down.</p><p>The only thing more important than me knowing all of that, though, was that my teammates did. Our catcher and captain, Thurman Munson, never said much to me about it. He spoke up about matters when he needed to and otherwise didn&#x2019;t say squat that didn&#x2019;t need to be said. He didn&#x2019;t have to pat me on the butt and tell me to do this or do that. But he had faith in me, and I had faith in him, and together we knew we could navigate our way through it. And the players behind&nbsp;me on the field knew I wouldn&#x2019;t be throwing as hard as usual&#x2014;so they adjusted their positioning. And as much as anything, those savvy adjustments won us the ball game.</p><p>Pitching in Fenway Park had never bothered me, honestly. Because of the Green Monster&#x2014;the close, towering wall in left field&#x2014;Fenway has a reputation for being tough on left-handed pitchers. But I knew I couldn&#x2019;t change the way I pitch because of the wall. Letting it get into my head, and trying to switch things up from what had been working for me all year, that&#x2019;s what could hurt me. In a one-game play-off, everything is as much mental as it is physical.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t do anything different to prepare because I had no time. By the time we lost on Sunday, and I decided that I&#x2019;d pitch against Boston on Monday, there was nothing to do but get a good night&#x2019;s sleep and try to do what I had done all season. And what I had done during the season first and foremost was to put my mind at rest. In the last month I had pitched against Boston twice. Both games were complete game, two-hit shutouts.</p><p>The first of those two, at Fenway, was part of what would be called &#x201c;the Boston Massacre.&#x201d; Boston was nearly unbeatable at home that season, winning fifty-nine games and losing just twenty-two. Four of those losses came during that series. A four-game sweep of Boston, in Boston. It was unheard-of. You don&#x2019;t do something like that to the Boston Red Sox in their park. I read later that we hadn&#x2019;t swept the Red Sox in Fenway since 1949. We&#x2019;d entered the series trailing them by four games in the division. We left it tied.</p><p>But it wasn&#x2019;t just that we won those four games. It was how we won, and the mental edge that we took from it. We scored forty-two runs in those four games. They put up only nine. They committed twelve errors in those four games. We made only five. We didn&#x2019;t just sweep them. We kicked their behinds. Because of that, we weren&#x2019;t afraid to play them over there, when they won the coin flip for the tiebreaker. It&#x2019;s not that we felt invincible&#x2014;I know I didn&#x2019;t. But we sure had confidence that we could beat them. They were more afraid of us than we were of them. Never in my career had I gone into Boston with the same confidence I had going into that game.</p><p>That wasn&#x2019;t the issue, though. The thing was we just didn&#x2019;t like &#x2019;em. But we had a lot of respect for the Sox, because they had a damn good team. As did we. It was a shame one of us had to lose.</p></p><h2>Melal: A Novel of the Pacific</h2><p>On Good Friday, 1981, Rujen Keju and his two sons come face to face with their complicated inheritance--one that includes years of atomic testing and the continued military presence of the U.S. in the Pacific.

By arranging the poems chronologically, Makoto Ueda has created an overview of the way in which this enigmatic seventeen-syllable form has been used and experimented with during different eras. At the same time, the reader is admitted to the often marginalized world of female experience in Japan, revealing voices every bit as rich and colorful, and perhaps even more lyrical and erotic, than those found in male haiku.<br><br>Listen, for instance, to Chiyojo, who worked in what has been long thought of as the dark age of haiku during the eighteenth century, but who composed exquisitely fine poems tracing the smallest workings of nature. Or Katsuro Nobuko, who wrote powerfully erotic poems when she was widowed after only two years of marriage. And here, too, is a voice from today, Mayuzumi Madoka, whose meditations on romantic love represent a fresh new approach to haiku.</p><p>Makoto Ueda is professor emeritus of Japanese at Stanford University.

Magnificently told in lip-biting detail&#39; - Daily Mail (The Red Line) The perfect complementary narrative to the bestselling memoir by Geoffrey Wellum - First Light. Achtung, Spitfire! The iconic Spitfire found fame during the darkest early days of World War II. But what happened to the redoubtable fighter and its crews beyond the Battle of Britain, and why is it still so loved today? In late spring 1940, Nazi Germany&#39;s domination of Europe had looked unstoppable. With the British Isles in easy reach since the fall of France, Adolf Hitler was convinced that Great Britain would be defeated in the skies over her southern coast, confident his Messerschmitts and Heinkels would outclass anything the Royal Air Force threw at them. What Hitler hadn&#39;t planned for was the agility and resilience of a marvel of British engineering that would quickly pass into legend - the Spitfire. Bestselling author John Nichol&#39;s passionate portrait of this magnificent fighter aircraft, its many innovations and updates, and the people who flew and loved them, carries the reader beyond the dogfights over Kent and Sussex. Spanning the full global reach of the Spitfire&#39;s deployment during WWII, from Malta to North Africa and the Far East, then over the D-Day beaches, it is always accessible, effortlessly entertaining and full of extraordinary spirit. Here are edge-of-the-seat stories and heart-stopping first-hand accounts of battling pilots forced to bail out over occupied territory; of sacrifice and wartime love; of aristocratic female flyers, and of the mechanics who braved the Nazi onslaught to keep the aircraft in battle-ready condition. Nichol takes the reader on a hair-raising, nail-biting and moving wartime history of the iconic Spitfire populated by a cast of redoubtable, heroic characters that make you want to stand up and cheer. `A rich and heartfelt tribute to this most iconic British machine.

This is her first book.This scathing memoir of a Christian and communist Lebanese woman is devoted not only to the author's as-yet short but eventful life, but also to a fierce indictment of Israeli military involvement in Lebanon and beyond. Bechara relates the childhood experience of war that formed her later persona as a strong and fearless crusader against Israeli occupation, her 1988 attempt to kill a militia leader in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon, and her capture and brutal incarceration. She reiterates throughout her memoir her abhorrence of violence and her view that her action was nevertheless acceptable and necessary. "After thirteen years of civil war and all kinds of horror, I realized that I was still just as resistant to brutality and force, still just as disturbed by violence, even the fictional violence shown on television...And I knew that I would have to overcome this repulsion." Her relentless denunciations of Israeli actions in Lebanon may lead some readers to question her objectivity regarding exceedingly complicated and painful events, but her story is a riveting and impassioned one that will keep the reader fascinated. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>This Is Just to Say: Poems of Apology and Forgiveness</h2><p>When Mrs. Merz asks her sixth grade class to write poems of apology, they end up liking their poems so much that they decide to put them together into a book.

A politically liberal Montmarte bohemian, he faithfully portrayed all aspects of Parisian life, but gave special attention to the everyday joys and sorrows of working people.<br>Perhaps no other sector of Steinlen's art is as strongly associated with his name today as his studies of cats.

Cats figure prominently in some of his most famous works, such as his great poster "Pure Sterilized Milk from the Vingeanne."<br>The cat drawing in the present volume are reproduced from two rare volumes: a 1933 collection of previously unpublished animal drawings (<i>Chats et autres b�tes</i>, published in an edition of only 545 copies), and a turn-of-the-century album of picture stories without words (<i>Des chats</i>).</p></p><p></p><h2>On Contemporary Art (ekphrasis)</h2><p>Translated into English for the first time, On Contemporary Art, a speech by the renowned novelist C�sar Aira, was delivered at a 2010 colloquium in Madrid dedicated to bridging the gap between writing and the visual arts. On Aira&#x2019;s dizzying and dazzling path, everything comes under question&#x2014;from reproducibility of artworks to the value of the written word itself. In the end, Aira leaves us stranded on the bridge between writing and art that he set out to construct in the first place, flailing as we try to make sense of where we stand. Aira&#x2019;s On Contemporary Art exemplifies what the ekphrasis series is dedicated to doing&#x2014;exploring the space in which words give meaning to objects, and objects shape our words. Like the great writers Walter Benjamin and Hermann Broch before him, Aira operates in the space between fiction and essay writing, art and analysis. Pursuing questions about reproducibility, art making, and limits of language, Aira&#x2019;s unique voice adds new insights to the essential conversations that continue to inform our understanding of art.</p><p>C�sar Aira was born in Coronel Pringles, Argentina in 1949, and has lived in Buenos Aires since 1967. He taught at the University of Buenos Aires and at the University of Rosario, and has translated and edited books from different languages. Perhaps one of the most prolific writers in Argentina, and certainly one of the most talked about in Latin America, Aira has published more than 120 books. Rights of his books have been sold to almost 30 countries. One novel, La prueba (1992), has been made into a feature film, and How I Became a Nun (1993) was chosen as one of Argentina&#x2019;s ten best books. Besides essays and novels Aira writes regularly for the Spanish newspaper El Pa�s. In 1996 he received a Guggenheim scholarship, in 2002 he was shortlisted for the R�mulo Gallegos prize, in 2015 he was shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, and in 2016 he was Guest of Honour at the International Literary Festival Berlin and was awarded the Premio Iberoamericano de Narrativa Manuel Rojas.An intellectual&#x2019;s stocking-filler, from Zwirner&#x2019;s charming, sleekly designed paperback &#x201c;Ekphrasis&#x201d; series.

Vienna wanted to dance and sing and forget war...and Poland was on the brink of war. In Paris, however, Chopin found himself warmly welcomed; his concerts became the vogue; his days were crowded with both gayety and the work he loved. Years passed and the world hailed his greatest compositions. Then ill health began making inroads on his time, and he went to Majorca, England, Scotland, seeking relief. However, time was running out, and, at the peak of his career, the great composer and pianist died in Paris, the city he loved. Thus, simply, yet with drama is completed this excellent two-volume biography of one of the world&#39;s greatest artists.</p><p></p>
